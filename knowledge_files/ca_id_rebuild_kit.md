## The point
No ID = locked out of everything. Here's how to get your California ID from scratch, even with zero documents.

### The order that works
1. **Birth certificate** (proves who you are)
2. **Social Security card** (proves your Social Security number)
3. **California ID card** (opens all doors - get it FREE if you're homeless)

**Total time:** 2-6 weeks if you start today
**Total cost:** $0-60 (or $0 if you qualify for free ID)

## What to Say (Scripts)

### Calling for Birth Certificate:
"Hi, I was born in [county] on [date]. I need a certified birth certificate to get an ID. Can I order one by phone and pay with a money order? Also, I don't have a stable address - can I pick it up in person or use General Delivery?"

### At Social Security Office:
"Hi, I need to replace my Social Security card. I have my birth certificate but no current ID. What else can I use to prove my identity?"

### Calling Homeless Service Organization:
"Hi, I'm experiencing homelessness and need help getting a California ID. Do you provide DMV fee waiver forms and homeless verification letters for no-fee IDs?"

## If That Fails

**Can't afford birth certificate?** Some counties waive fees - call and ask about fee waivers for homeless individuals

**SSA won't accept your documents?** Bring anything else with your name: jail release papers, hospital bracelet, old mail

**No homeless service nearby?** Call **211** and ask: "Who can help me get a DMV fee waiver for a no-fee California ID?"
