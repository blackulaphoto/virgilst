## The point
This is the “what do I SAY” sheet. Because the system responds to the right words.

---

## Getting a PCP appointment
“Hi, I need the earliest appointment available. I’m having (symptoms) and I also need help with medications/referrals. What’s the soonest opening, and do you have cancellations?”

If they push you out weeks:
“Is there an urgent slot, walk-in hours, or another clinic location with sooner availability?”

---

## Asking for a specialist referral
“At this visit, I need a referral to (specialty) for (reason). What is the process and timeline for authorization? How do I confirm it was sent?”

---

## Medication refill when you’re out
“I’m out of (med). I need a refill today. Can the provider send it electronically to my pharmacy? If there are no refills, what is the fastest way to get an emergency supply or same-day appointment?”

If they say no:
“Can you document that I requested a refill today and it was declined, and tell me the next step?”

---

## After ER / hospital follow-up
“I was seen in the ER/hospital on (date). They told me to follow up within (time). I need an appointment and I need the doctor to review my discharge paperwork.”

---

## If staff is rude or dismissive
“I’m trying to solve this, not argue. Can you tell me the policy and who I speak to for escalation if I’m still stuck?”
