## “I’m not suicidal, but I don’t feel safe”
Say this on the phone:
“I’m not trying to die, but I do not feel safe right now and I need crisis support and options tonight.”

If someone dismisses you, repeat:
“I’m asking for crisis support and a safe plan for tonight.”

---

## Overdose / medical danger
If someone is not waking up, breathing weird, turning blue, or you suspect overdose:
- **Call 911**
- If you have naloxone (Narcan), use it and keep monitoring breathing.
- Stay with the person if safe.

## What to do in the next 10 minutes
1) Pick one: **ACCESS line** (mental health) or **SASH** (substance use), or **988** (crisis support).
2) Tell them: where you are, if you’re alone, and what you need *tonight*.
3) Ask: “What is my next step after this call? Who do I call if the plan falls apart?”
