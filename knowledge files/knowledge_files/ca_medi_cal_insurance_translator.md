## The point
You have Medi-Cal but can't see a doctor? Here's how to actually use your insurance to get care.

---

## What to do TODAY

### Find Out Your Medi-Cal Plan
Call **Health Care Options**: **(800) 300-5553**

- They'll tell you: Blue Shield, Health Net, LA Care, etc.
- Write it down - you'll need this

### Find Your Primary Doctor (PCP)
Your primary doctor is your "main" doctor who you see for everything first.

## How to See a Specialist (Dermatologist, Cardiologist, etc.)

You CAN'T just call a specialist directly. Here's what actually works:

### Step 1: See Your Primary Doctor First
- Call your primary doctor's office
- Make an appointment
- Tell them: "I need a referral to see a [specialist type] for [your problem]"

### Step 2: Get the Referral
At your appointment, ask:
- "Can you send the referral today?"
- "What specialist are you referring me to?"
- "What's the specialist's phone number?"

### Step 3: Call the Specialist
Wait 2-3 days, then call the specialist's office:
- "Hi, my doctor sent a referral. Has it come through yet?"
- If yes: Make your appointment
- If no: Call your primary doctor back and ask them to resend it

## Common Problems & How to Fix Them

### "I Don't Like My Doctor - Can I Change?"
**YES! Call Health Care Options: (800) 300-5553**
- Say: "I want to change my primary care doctor"
- Pick a new one from their list
- Usually takes effect within 1-2 weeks

### "I Want to Change My Whole Health Plan"
**You can change once per year, or if you have a good reason**

Call Health Care Options: **(800) 300-5553**
- Available plans: Blue Shield, Health Net, LA Care, Kaiser (depends on your county)
- They'll tell you which you can switch to

### "My Doctor Won't Give Me a Referral"
Try this:
1. Ask again and be specific: "I need a referral to [specialist] because [symptom]"
2. If they still say no, ask: "Why not? What do I need to do to get this referral?"
3. Still no? Call Member Services for your health plan (number on back of your card)
4. Say: "My doctor won't give me a needed referral. Can you help?"

## What to Say (Phone Scripts)

### Calling to Find Your Doctor:
"Hi, I have Medi-Cal and I need to know who my primary care doctor is. Can you tell me their name and phone number?"

### Calling to Make First Appointment:
"Hi, I'm a new patient with Medi-Cal [your health plan name]. I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. [name]."

### Asking for a Referral:
"I need a referral to see a [type of specialist] for [your problem]. Can you put in the referral today and tell me which specialist you're sending me to?"

## If That Fails
- **Can't reach Health Care Options?** Call Medi-Cal directly: (800) 952-5253
- **Health plan won't help?** File a complaint: (888) 452-8609 (DHCS Managed Care Ombudsman)
- **Emergency?** Go to ER - Medi-Cal covers it, no referral needed
