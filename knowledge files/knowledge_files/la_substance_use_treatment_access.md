## The point
If you’re trying to get into treatment in LA County, the first win is **getting connected to the right door** without being bounced.

---

## 24/7: Substance Abuse Service Helpline (SASH)
SASH does screening and connects you to treatment providers.

**Call:** 1-844-804-7500 (24/7)

**What to say**
“I want treatment. I need help figuring out what level of care I need and getting connected to a provider near me. I’m in (area/city).”

**Ask**
- “Can you stay on the line while the appointment is scheduled?”
- “What should I do if the provider can’t see me soon?”

---

## In-person assessment / linkage
Your internal resource list includes **community assessment service centers** (by SPA). If you can’t get traction by phone, in-person screening is often faster.

**Move**
- Go to an assessment site with any ID you have (even partial).
- Tell them: “I need linkage to treatment today.”

## “Detox or not?” quick screen (not medical advice)
Detox is usually needed if you’re at risk of dangerous withdrawal (alcohol/benzos especially).
If you’re unsure, call SASH and be honest about:
- what you’re using
- last use
- history of withdrawal seizures
- medical conditions

If you feel medically unsafe: go to the ER.
