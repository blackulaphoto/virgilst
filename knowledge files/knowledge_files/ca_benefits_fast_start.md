## What to Say (Phone Script)
"Hi, I need to apply for CalFresh food stamps and Medi-Cal health insurance. I have very little money right now, so I think I qualify for emergency CalFresh. Can you help me apply over the phone or tell me the fastest way to apply? Also, I don't have a stable address right now - how can I receive notices and my EBT card?"

---

## If That Fails
- **CalFresh Hotline:** (877) 847-3663 - Ask about application help
- **Call 211:** They can connect you with application assistance programs
- **Walk into any county welfare office** - They MUST help you apply even if you're not from that county
