Overview of Partner Clinics

At or through URM, guests can access:

    UCLA Homeless Healthcare Collaborative (mobile and street-based medical care).​​

    USC Dental Clinic, providing comprehensive dental care including pediatric dentistry.​

    Pepperdine Mental Health Clinic (Jerry Butler Clinic) for trauma and substance-use-related psychological care.​

    ​

These clinics focus on people experiencing homelessness or extreme poverty, and services are generally free to URM guests.
​
Who This Is For

These clinics are particularly for:

    Current URM emergency guests (using shelter or meals).​

    Participants in URM recovery and transitional programs (Emmaus, Damascus Road, S.E.S., F.E.S.).​

    People experiencing homelessness in Skid Row referred by URM or partner shelters.​​

Some services may also be available to neighboring unhoused community members if capacity allows, especially through mobile outreach like UCLA’s Homeless Healthcare Collaborative.​
UCLA Homeless Healthcare Collaborative at URM

The UCLA Homeless Healthcare Collaborative (HHC) offers mobile primary and urgent care services to people experiencing homelessness across Los Angeles, including URM and Hope Gardens.
​

What services are provided

    Primary care (checkups, chronic disease management for conditions like diabetes, hypertension, asthma).

    Urgent care for minor injuries, infections, wound care, respiratory illnesses, and similar issues.

    Vaccinations, basic lab work, medication refills, and health education, depending on mobile clinic capabilities.​

    Trauma-informed care that considers the impact of long-term homelessness and trauma on health.

Who qualifies

    People experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles, including URM guests and nearby residents of Skid Row.​

    No insurance is required; lack of ID should not prevent care.​

Cost

    Services are provided free of charge to patients.​

How to access

    At URM, ask front desk or case management when the UCLA HHC team is onsite or doing street outreach nearby.​​

    Clinics may take place inside URM’s clinic space or from a mobile van parked near the facility.​

    You may be seen on a first-come, first-served basis or given a same-day time slot, depending on the day’s schedule.​

Required documents

    Typically none are strictly required; if you have ID and medical cards, bring them, but they are not a barrier to care.​

Referral process and timeline

    Walk-in when the team is present or get a referral from URM staff.​​

    Many patients can be seen same day when the clinic is onsite; follow-up visits may be set for the next visit day at URM or another HHC location.​

    For specialty care (e.g., surgery, complex diagnostics), UCLA or other hospital systems may arrange referrals; timelines vary from a few days to several weeks.

    Dentures or partial dentures in selected cases, subject to program resources.​

    Ask URM staff or front desk to be placed on the dental clinic list or for the next clinic day.​

    You may need a brief screening or referral through URM’s support services to prioritize your case.​

Required documents

    Usually minimal; if you have ID, bring it, but lack of documentation should not stop emergency pain treatment.​

Referral process and timeline

    For non-urgent care, expect to wait days to weeks depending on demand and clinic schedule, as USC faculty, residents, and students rotate through.​

    Urgent cases (severe pain, infection, swelling) may be prioritized more quickly.​

    URM or USC may refer you to other dental facilities if specialized procedures are needed and capacity is limited.​

What To Expect When Using URM Clinics

    Services are often run by licensed professionals working with supervised students and residents (medicine, dentistry, law, psychology).
    ​

    Appointments may be limited by clinic days and provider availability; you may spend time waiting but can usually access other URM services while on campus.​

    Most services focus on essential, stabilizing care: pain relief, safety, stabilizing health and legal status, and supporting recovery goals.​

    You retain confidentiality protections under health and legal ethics, within the limits staff will explain to you (e.g., mandated reporting).

How To Apply or Get Connected

You typically do not submit an online application; instead, you connect while staying at or visiting URM.

    Start by visiting URM at 545 S. San Pedro St or calling (213) 347-6300.

    Ask the front desk or your case manager for:

        “UCLA medical clinic,”

        “USC dental clinic,”

        “Pepperdine mental health,” or

        “Pepperdine legal aid at Union Rescue Mission.”​

    Bring any relevant documents (medical records, court papers, tickets, medication lists).​

    Expect screening and scheduling based on urgency, with some services available same day and others booked out for future dates.
