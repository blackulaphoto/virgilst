Men’s Emmaus Recovery Program

Emmaus is URM’s faith-based residential recovery program for men, designed to address addiction and deep-rooted trauma while building pathways to work, education, and housing.​
Program Overview

Emmaus includes three main phases:​

    Phase 1: Assessments (Seeds of Hope – about 1 month).

    Phase 2: Trauma-informed recovery (Emmaus – about 6–9 months).

    Phase 3: Apprenticeship model (up to 18 months).​

Men live at URM during the program and often remain onsite for apprenticeships as they transition toward independence.​
Who This Is For

Emmaus is intended for:

    Adult men experiencing homelessness or extreme instability with significant substance use or behavioral issues.​

    Men who want a structured, faith-based recovery environment lasting at least several months.​

    Men ready to engage in trauma-informed treatment, work therapy, and spiritual growth.​

Phase 1: Assessments (ASAM, ACE, TABE, and more)

Purpose

    Understand each man’s history, needs, and strengths to build an individualized recovery plan.​

Assessments used

    ASAM assessment (American Society of Addiction Medicine): A structured tool to determine the severity of substance use and the appropriate level of care (e.g., outpatient, residential, medical management).​​

    ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) score: Evaluates early-life trauma (abuse, neglect, household dysfunction), which is strongly linked to later addiction and health problems.​

    TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education): Measures reading, writing, and math skills to guide education and vocational planning.​

    Additional tools such as ESL evaluation and self-sufficiency measures may also be used.​

What ASAM is

    ASAM criteria are national standards used to place individuals in appropriate addiction treatment levels based on six dimensions (such as withdrawal potential, medical conditions, readiness to change, and relapse risk).​​

    By using ASAM, URM aligns with evidence-based practice to match services to each man’s actual needs rather than a “one-size-fits-all” model.​

Detox and stabilization

    Early days focus on detox and stabilization, sometimes in collaboration with medical providers.​

    Men begin attending groups, chapels, and early recovery sessions while completing assessments.​

Phase 2: Trauma-Informed Recovery

What “trauma-informed” means

    Recognizing that many men’s addictions and behaviors are rooted in unresolved trauma, not just “bad choices.”​

    Providing services that prioritize safety, trustworthiness, peer support, collaboration, and empowerment.​

    Avoiding practices that can re-trigger trauma while building skills to manage triggers and emotions.​

Core elements of Phase 2

    Christian foundation with prayer, Bible study, and chapel.​

    12-Step recovery and addiction education.​

    Individual and group therapy, including anger management, grief recovery, and emotionally healthy relationships.​

    Financial planning and education/vocational training support.​

    Regular engagement with a loving church community.​

Pepperdine’s Mental Health Clinic supports this trauma-informed approach by providing psychological services tailored to men in recovery.​
Phase 3: Apprenticeship Model

Purpose

    Bridge the gap between treatment and full independence through structured work and continued support.​

Structure

    Up to 18 months, often broken into three 6‑month apprenticeship terms.​

    Men live at URM while working, attending school, or completing vocational training.​

Work therapy and employment

    Men may work in URM departments (kitchen, maintenance, guest services) or external placements as they secure jobs.​

    The goal is to build a solid employment history, demonstrate reliability, and develop references.​

Housing during program

    Men in apprenticeship usually continue to stay onsite at URM; this allows them to save money while paying low or no rent.​

    This model supports building a savings cushion for move-in costs (deposit, first month’s rent) once they transition to permanent housing.​

Faith-Based Elements

    Regular chapel services, Bible studies, prayer times, and discipleship are integrated across all phases.​

    Recovery is framed as reconnecting with God, self, and others, with emphasis on grace, accountability, and community.​

    Men are encouraged to engage with local churches and faith communities as part of their long-term support network.​

Participation in these elements is central to the Emmaus model; men should be comfortable with a Christian recovery environment, even if they are in different stages of belief.​
Employment Outcomes & Transition Planning

Employment outcomes

    Many graduates move into steady employment, often in trades, service industries, or roles connected to their training.​

    Some pursue further education, trade school, or ministry training.​

Transition planning

    Throughout Phases 2 and 3, case managers help men set realistic goals for income, savings, and housing.​

    Plans may include:

        Securing full-time work before graduation.

        Saving a set amount toward deposits and emergency funds.

        Applying for housing programs or affordable units.​

Realistic timelines

    From entering Phase 1 through the end of apprenticeship, a man might spend 1.5–3 years connected to Emmaus and URM support.​

    Progress depends on individual recovery pace, relapse episodes, health, and job market conditions.​

Eligibility, Application, and Program Limitations

Eligibility

    Adult men, typically 18+, experiencing homelessness and seeking long-term recovery.​

    Ability to live in a structured, faith-based environment and follow program rules.​

How to apply

    If staying at URM, speak to a chaplain, case manager, or intake worker and say you are interested in the “Emmaus Recovery Program.”​

    If you are outside URM, call (213) 347-6300 and ask about intake for men’s recovery.​

    Expect an interview, assessments, and possibly medical clearance or detox prior to full entry.​

Limitations

    Not a medical or psychiatric hospital; men requiring intensive inpatient or psychiatric care may be referred to higher-level facilities first.​

    Space is limited; wait lists are possible, and admission may depend on bed availability and readiness for the program.​
