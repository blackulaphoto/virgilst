Housing help in California can feel overwhelming, especially if you are already in crisis or trying to avoid losing your housing. The reality is that there is no single application that takes you straight from a shelter bed into a Section 8 voucher; most people move through several layers of programs, waitlists, and referrals before they reach truly **stable** housing. This guide walks you through a realistic, step‑by‑step pathway you can follow in California, with phone numbers, websites, and tips to help you stay organized and persistent. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)

## Introduction: Why Housing Help Feels So Confusing in California

California uses a layered system: local homeless systems (Coordinated Entry), county benefits (like CalWORKs, General Relief, HDAP), federal housing vouchers and affordable housing properties, plus special pathways for veterans, survivors of violence, and disabled people. These systems are managed by different agencies (HUD, California Department of Social Services (CDSS), local Continuums of Care (CoCs), county DPSS offices, and nonprofits), so you often need multiple applications and referrals at the same time. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

Housing help rarely works “first come, first served.” Instead, California communities use “vulnerability” or “prioritization” scores in Coordinated Entry to decide who is offered limited housing resources first. At the same time, county programs like CalWORKs Housing Support Program, Homeless Assistance, and HDAP can help with motel stays, move‑in costs, and short‑term rent support while you wait for longer‑term options. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)

There is also no single statewide waitlist for Section 8 or affordable housing; every housing authority and every building usually has its own application and waitlist, which means casting a wide net is essential. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

## Section 1: Step One – Emergency Shelter & Coordinated Entry

### Call 211 to Start

In most of California, your first step is to contact 211, which connects you to local shelters, outreach teams, and Coordinated Entry. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)

- Statewide 211 website: https://211ca.org [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)
- You can dial **211** from most phones to reach your local 211.  

Local 211 examples (these route based on your location):  

- Los Angeles County: dialing 211 or visiting https://www.211la.org connects you to LA County’s homeless services and Coordinated Entry access points. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)
- Bay Area (example): 211 services (such as 211 Bay Area) route people to local CoC‑funded programs and shelters in counties like San Francisco, Alameda, and Santa Clara. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)
- San Diego County: 211 San Diego connects to the Regional Task Force on Homelessness Coordinated Entry System. [rtfhsd](https://www.rtfhsd.org/about-coc/coordinated-entry-system-ces/)

211 can:  

- Tell you where to go for shelter or an in‑person assessment.  
- Schedule or direct you to a Coordinated Entry assessment.  
- Connect you to county benefits offices and legal help.  

[Citations] [rtfhsd](https://www.rtfhsd.org/about-coc/coordinated-entry-system-ces/)

### Coordinated Entry and Continuums of Care (CoCs)

HUD requires each Continuum of Care (CoC) – the regional homeless system – to run a Coordinated Entry System (CES) that standardizes how people access housing and services. A CoC is usually county‑wide or multi‑county and includes shelters, outreach teams, rapid rehousing, and permanent supportive housing programs funded by HUD’s homelessness programs. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)

Key points about Coordinated Entry in California:  

- It is meant to be a single front door so you don’t have to apply separately to every homeless program. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)
- Access points can be shelters, drop‑in centers, outreach teams, or special sites for youth or domestic violence survivors. [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/docs/gpp/california-provider/CA_CAID_HomelessCoordinatedEntrySystems.pdf?v=202411131531)
- HUD requires CoC and ESG‑funded programs to participate in CES and to use a standardized assessment and prioritization process. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)

California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) also encourages counties to use Housing First and Coordinated Entry for state‑funded programs, including Homekey projects and state homelessness grants. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)

[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)

### How Assessments Work and Why Vulnerability Scores Matter

When you connect with CES, staff or outreach workers will:  

- Collect basic information (name, DOB, contact info, where you are sleeping).  
- Ask about your housing history, disabilities, health, safety, and other needs.  
- Use a standardized tool (often a modified VI‑SPDAT or similar) to assign a vulnerability score that helps prioritize who gets limited resources. [csocstan](https://csocstan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CES-Policy.pdf)

Information is usually entered into an HMIS (Homeless Management Information System) so that different providers in the CoC can see your profile and match you to openings. Higher vulnerability scores (for example, chronic homelessness, serious health issues, high risk of harm) are prioritized for scarce slots like permanent supportive housing and some rapid rehousing programs. [housingfirstsolano](https://www.housingfirstsolano.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Policies-and-Procedures.pdf)

This does **not** mean you did anything wrong if you are not placed quickly; it usually means there are more people in need than there are units or subsidies available. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

## Section 2: Step Two – County Support Programs (DPSS / CalWORKs / General Relief)

After you connect with Coordinated Entry, your next move is usually to apply for county benefits and housing programs. In most counties, this is through the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) or Social Services Agency.  

### Key California State Housing Programs (CDSS)

CDSS runs several housing and homelessness programs that counties operate locally. Main housing programs page: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)

Programs to know:  

1. **CalWORKs Housing Support Program (HSP)**  
   - Helps CalWORKs families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to obtain and keep permanent housing. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-housing-support-program)
   - Can provide: temporary shelter (including **hotel/motel vouchers**), rental assistance, security deposits, utility payments, moving costs, and intensive case management/housing navigation. [heartofsmc](https://www.heartofsmc.org/resource/the-calworks-housing-support-program/)
   - You must be a CalWORKs family (with a child or pregnant and meeting income rules). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)
   - Access: Apply for CalWORKs at your county welfare office (DPSS) and ask specifically for HSP. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)

2. **CalWORKs Homeless Assistance (HA)**  
   - Offers **Temporary Homeless Assistance**: payments for emergency shelter (often motels) for up to 16 days, generally once every 12 months (with some exceptions). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
   - Offers **Permanent Homeless Assistance**: help with security deposit, last month’s rent, or up to two months of back rent to secure or maintain housing. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
   - For CalWORKs recipients or apparently eligible applicants who are homeless or at risk. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)

3. **Housing and Disability Advocacy Program (HDAP)**  
   - Helps people who are homeless or at risk and likely eligible for disability benefits (SSI/SSDI). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)
   - Provides outreach, case management, disability benefits advocacy (help with SSI/SSDI applications), and housing assistance (interim shelter, rental assistance, security deposits, utilities, moving costs, legal services, credit repair). [ocpsc.ca](https://ocpsc.ca.gov/the-housing-and-disability-advocacy-program/)
   - Funded statewide and run by counties; HDAP has specific funding through at least June 2028. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2026/01/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program-funding-for-fiscal-year-2025-26/)

4. **Bringing Families Home (BFH)**  
   - A CDSS program to help families in the child welfare system who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to secure housing. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)
   - Works through county child welfare departments in partnership with housing providers to help reunify families or prevent foster care entries when housing is the barrier. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/calworks/assets/Updates/Updates2023/CalWORKs_Update_23-05.htm)

CDSS Overview: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)

[Citations] [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-housing-support-program)

### Example: Los Angeles County DPSS

Los Angeles County’s DPSS website: https://dpss.lacounty.gov [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)

Through LA County DPSS you can:  

- Apply for **CalWORKs**, **General Relief**, and **CalFresh**, which can open the door to HSP, HA, and HDAP.  
- Ask to be screened for county‑funded housing programs linked to these benefits.  

In LA County, these programs often coordinate with the CoC and CES, so being enrolled can help with referrals to rapid rehousing, interim housing, or permanent supportive housing when available. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

[Citations] [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

### Who Qualifies and How to Apply

- **CalWORKs + HSP/HA**: Low‑income families with children or pregnant individuals, California residents, meeting income/resource limits. Apply online or in person at your county DPSS/SSA; ask about Homeless Assistance and HSP specifically. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)
- **HDAP**: Individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness who are likely to qualify for disability benefits; counties must provide disability advocacy and housing assistance. Ask your county welfare office or HDAP point of contact (often through DPSS/behavioral health). [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2026/01/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program-funding-for-fiscal-year-2025-26/)
- **BFH**: Families involved in child welfare (CPS/Children and Family Services) who are homeless or at risk; ask your child welfare social worker about Bringing Families Home. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/calworks/assets/Updates/Updates2023/CalWORKs_Update_23-05.htm)

[Citations] [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)

### Key Differences: Motels vs Move‑In Costs vs Ongoing Rent Help

- **Temporary motel vouchers**  
  - Typically from CalWORKs Homeless Assistance or HSP as “interim shelter assistance.”  
  - Short term (for HA, up to 16 days in most cases). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
- **Security deposit / move‑in assistance**  
  - CalWORKs HA can pay security deposit and last month’s rent or back rent. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
  - HSP and HDAP can also fund deposits, utilities, and moving costs as part of housing stabilization. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-housing-support-program)
- **Ongoing rent subsidies**  
  - HSP often uses a rapid‑rehousing‑style model: short to medium‑term rental subsidies plus case management. [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)
  - HDAP can provide rental assistance while disability benefits applications are pending. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2026/01/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program-funding-for-fiscal-year-2025-26/)
  - Long‑term subsidies usually come from Section 8/Housing Choice Vouchers or permanent supportive housing, not from CalWORKs alone. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

[Citations] [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)

## Section 3: Step Three – Rapid Rehousing & Bridge Housing

### What “Bridge Housing” Means in California

Bridge housing is short‑term or medium‑term housing meant to “bridge” you from homelessness (shelter, street, motel) into permanent housing. It can look like: [longbeach](https://www.longbeach.gov/globalassets/homelessness/media-library/documents/document-library/coc-ces-policies-and-procedures--final-062023-)

- Motel or hotel converted into temporary or interim housing.  
- Dorm‑style or small private units with on‑site support services.  
- Time‑limited stays with the goal of moving to permanent housing (voucher unit, tax credit apartment, permanent supportive housing).  

Many Homekey‑funded projects in California started as interim or bridge housing by converting hotels and motels. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)

- Homekey info: https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-funding/programs-active/homekey [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)

[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)

### What Rapid Rehousing Is

Rapid rehousing is a housing intervention that provides short‑ to medium‑term rental assistance and services to help people quickly move into and stabilize in housing. It usually includes: [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)

- Help finding a unit and negotiating with landlords.  
- Time‑limited rental assistance (for example 3–24 months, depending on program and budget).  
- Case management focused on increasing income and keeping the housing.  

California uses rapid rehousing in CalWORKs HSP, local CoC programs, and some state homelessness initiatives. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)

[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)

### How You Get Referred (Usually Not Direct Application)

Most rapid rehousing and bridge‑housing programs in California **do not** accept walk‑in or direct applications. Instead:  

- They pull clients from the CoC’s Coordinated Entry System “community queue” based on vulnerability and program fit. [sbchp.sbcounty](https://sbchp.sbcounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2024/09/San-Bernardino-County-CES-Training-Manual-7-2024.pdf)
- Some county programs (for example HSP, HDAP) may directly enroll people who qualify for their benefits, then coordinate with CES for permanent housing referrals. [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/docs/gpp/california-provider/CA_CAID_HomelessCoordinatedEntrySystems.pdf?v=202411131531)

This is why Step One (Coordinated Entry) and Step Two (County DPSS/CDSS programs) are so important; they position you for these referrals when slots open.  

[Citations] [sbchp.sbcounty](https://sbchp.sbcounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2024/09/San-Bernardino-County-CES-Training-Manual-7-2024.pdf)

### Documents Typically Required

For rapid rehousing or bridge housing, programs commonly ask for:  

- ID and Social Security number (or proof of having applied).  
- Proof of homelessness (shelter letter, outreach verification, eviction notice, motel receipts).  
- Income information (pay stubs, benefit letters, or statement that you have no income).  
- For some programs, disability or veteran status documentation where relevant.  

These requirements come from HUD and state definitions of homelessness and program eligibility. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)

[Citations] [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)

## Section 4: Step Four – Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)

### What Section 8 Is

The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program – commonly called “Section 8” – is a federal program that helps low‑income households afford housing in the private market by paying a portion of the rent directly to the landlord. Participants usually pay around 30% of their adjusted income toward rent, and the voucher covers the rest up to a payment standard set by the local Public Housing Agency (PHA). [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

- HUD HCV tenant info: https://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

[Citations] [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

### Waitlists and How to Find PHAs

Each PHA runs its own Section 8 waitlist, and many in California keep their lists closed for long periods because demand is so high. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

- HUD PHA contact tool (nationwide, including California PHAs):  
  https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

Major California PHAs include, for example:  

- Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA): https://www.hacla.org [hacla](https://www.hacla.org/en/about-section-8/homeless-initiatives)
- San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA – functions now integrated into city housing agencies but still uses HUD programs). [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)
- Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency (SHRA): https://www.shra.org [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)
- San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC): https://www.sdhc.org [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)

Each PHA website will tell you:  

- If the HCV/Section 8 waitlist is open or closed.  
- How to apply when open (often online).  
- Whether they have special waitlists (for example, project‑based vouchers, homeless set‑aside, veterans).  

[Citations] [hacla](https://www.hacla.org/en/about-section-8/homeless-initiatives)

### Income Limits and Eligibility

Section 8 is targeted to low‑income households, generally those with income at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI), with some vouchers targeted to those at or below 30% of AMI. PHAs use HUD’s income limits for their area and may give preference to certain groups (for example, local residents, homeless households, veterans), as allowed by HUD rules. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

[Citations] [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

### Timeline Realities (1–10+ Years)

Because rents in California are high and federal voucher funding is limited, Section 8 waitlists in large metro areas can be extremely long. It is common for people to wait several years between applying and receiving a voucher when lists are open at all. In some high‑cost areas, advocates and PHAs report wait times of 5–10+ years between application and selection, especially when the PHA uses a lottery system. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

There is no guaranteed timeline, and many people never reach the top if they move, miss notices, or the PHA closes the list before reaching them. This is why you should never rely on Section 8 alone as your only plan.  

[Citations] [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

### Source‑of‑Income Protections in California

California law protects tenants from discrimination based on “source of income,” which includes housing vouchers such as Section 8. [calcivilrights.ca](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/housing/)

- California Civil Rights Department (Housing Discrimination page): https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/housing [calcivilrights.ca](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/housing/)
- California DOJ tenant info: https://oag.ca.gov/tenants [oag.ca](https://oag.ca.gov/tenants)

Landlords generally cannot refuse to rent to you just because you have a Section 8 voucher or other rental assistance; that can be illegal discrimination. If you believe you are being denied housing because of your voucher or another protected characteristic, you can file a complaint with the Civil Rights Department. [oag.ca](https://oag.ca.gov/tenants)

[Citations] [oag.ca](https://oag.ca.gov/tenants)

***

## Section 5: Step Five – Low‑Income & Affordable Housing Units

Even if you are waiting on Section 8 or don’t qualify, you can apply directly to affordable housing buildings.  

### HUD Resource Locator

The HUD Resource Locator helps you find subsidized properties, public housing, and HUD‑assisted apartments near you. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

- HUD Resource Locator: https://resources.hud.gov [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

Important:  

- The Locator **does not** show current vacancies; you must call each property to ask about availability and waitlists. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)
- HUD does not manage the waiting lists; each property has its own process. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

[Citations]  

### Tax Credit Properties (LIHTC)

Low‑Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties make up a large share of affordable rentals in California. Developers receive tax credits in exchange for renting units at restricted rents to lower‑income households. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

- LIHTC units have maximum income limits, but rents are not based on your exact income; they are set by the unit’s restrictions. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)
- Many LIHTC properties accept Section 8 vouchers as payment and can be used with your voucher when you receive one. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

HUD’s California page explains LIHTC properties and links to maps of tax credit properties. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

- California HUD page: http://www.hud.gov/states/california [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)
- California Affordable Housing Map (nonprofit resource listing LIHTC and other subsidized housing): https://affordablehomes.chpc.net [affordablehomes.chpc](https://affordablehomes.chpc.net)

[Citations] [affordablehomes.chpc](https://affordablehomes.chpc.net)

### Applying Directly to Property Managers

For both HUD‑assisted and LIHTC properties, you usually:  

- Contact the property manager or owner (phone or website).  
- Ask for an application and whether the waitlist is open.  
- Submit income, household, and identification documents.  

Each building often has:  

- Its own application.  
- Its own waitlist and screening process.  
- Different preferences (for example, seniors, families, formerly homeless).  

[Citations] [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)

### Project‑Based Section 8 vs Voucher‑Based

- **Voucher‑based Section 8 (Housing Choice Voucher)**  
  - Voucher is attached to you, not a particular unit.  
  - You can choose any unit that passes inspection and where the landlord accepts the voucher.  
  - If you move, you can often take the voucher with you (subject to PHA rules). [oxnard](https://www.oxnard.gov/housing/section-8)

- **Project‑based Section 8**  
  - Subsidy is attached to a specific building or unit.  
  - You apply to the property; if accepted, your rent is income‑based, but if you move out you usually do not take the subsidy with you. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)

Many California PHAs combine project‑based vouchers with affordable housing developments, so it can be easier to get into some project‑based units than to reach the top of a standard voucher waitlist. [nelsonmullins](https://www.nelsonmullins.com/insights/alerts/nelson-mullins-affordable-housing-news/all/2025-updates-to-hud-s-section-8-program-key-considerations-for-developers-and-phas)

## Section 6: Special Pathways

Some groups in California have specific housing pathways layered on top of the general system.  

### Veterans – HUD‑VASH and VA Services

HUD‑VASH combines Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance with VA case management and clinical services for eligible homeless veterans. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-homeless-veterans)

- HUD‑VASH overview: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hud-vash [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hud-vash/)

- VA National Call Center for Homeless Veterans: **1‑877‑4AID‑VET (1‑877‑424‑3838)** [va](https://www.va.gov/greater-los-angeles-health-care/health-services/homeless-veteran-care/)

In California, PHAs like HACLA partner with local VA medical centers to administer HUD‑VASH vouchers, helping veterans move into permanent housing with ongoing support. [housing.lacounty](https://housing.lacounty.gov/press/articles/VeteransResources.html)

[Citations] [211sj](https://211sj.org/v2-detail/?idServiceAtLocation=91833061)

### Domestic Violence Survivors

Survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking can access confidential services and sometimes dedicated shelter or housing programs. CoCs must ensure safe, confidential access to Coordinated Entry for survivors and partner with victim service providers. [housingfirstsolano](https://www.housingfirstsolano.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Policies-and-Procedures.pdf)

- 211 can connect you to local domestic violence shelters and hotlines in your county: https://211ca.org [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)
- Many CoCs have separate access points or procedures for survivors to protect safety and privacy. [sbchp.sbcounty](https://sbchp.sbcounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2024/09/San-Bernardino-County-CES-Training-Manual-7-2024.pdf)

Survivors should ask about:  

- Confidential shelter.  
- Flexible funding for relocation and security deposits (often through local DV agencies and state grants).  
- Safety planning around CES participation.  

[Citations] [sbchp.sbcounty](https://sbchp.sbcounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2024/09/San-Bernardino-County-CES-Training-Manual-7-2024.pdf)

### Families in Child Welfare – Bringing Families Home (BFH)

Bringing Families Home (BFH) is designed for families in the child welfare system where housing instability is a barrier to reunification or safety. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/calworks/assets/Updates/Updates2023/CalWORKs_Update_23-05.htm)

- BFH can fund housing navigation, rental assistance, and supportive services so that children can reunify with parents or avoid foster care placement due to homelessness. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/calworks/assets/Updates/Updates2023/CalWORKs_Update_23-05.htm)
- Ask your child welfare social worker or county child welfare office about BFH and related housing supports.

### Disabled Individuals – HDAP → SSI/SSDI

For people with significant disabilities who are homeless or at risk, HDAP provides:  

- Intensive case management.  
- Help applying for SSI/SSDI (disability benefits).  
- Interim housing assistance (including shelter/motels, rental assistance, and move‑in costs) while the disability claim is pending. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)

Once approved for SSI/SSDI, some individuals may qualify for long‑term supportive housing, project‑based units, or may use the steady income to qualify for LIHTC or other affordable housing units.

## Section 7: Realistic Pathway Summary (Roadmap)

Here is a realistic, layered pathway many Californians follow. You might not hit every step, and you can work on several at once.  

1. **Call 211 → Enter Coordinated Entry**  
   - Dial 211 or visit https://211ca.org to get connected to local shelters, outreach, and your CoC’s Coordinated Entry System. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

2. **Apply for County Housing Assistance**  
   - Visit or contact your county DPSS/social services (for example, LA County DPSS: https://dpss.lacounty.gov) to apply for CalWORKs, General Relief, HSP, HA, and HDAP if you may qualify. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)

3. **Stabilize with Temporary Aid**  
   - Use motel vouchers, emergency shelter, and short‑term assistance (CalWORKs HA, HSP, HDAP) to get off the street and gather documents. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)

4. **Get Referred to Rapid Rehousing or Bridge Housing**  
   - Through CES and county programs, seek referrals to rapid rehousing or bridge‑housing programs when your vulnerability and program fit line up with an opening. [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)

5. **Apply to All Open Section 8 Waitlists Statewide**  
   - Regularly check HUD’s PHA contact list and major PHA websites (HACLA, SHRA, SDHC, etc.) for open waitlists and apply whenever you see an opening. [hacla](https://www.hacla.org/en/about-section-8/homeless-initiatives)

6. **Apply to Tax Credit and Project‑Based Units**  
   - Use HUD Resource Locator (https://resources.hud.gov), HUD’s California page, and tools like the California Affordable Housing Map (https://affordablehomes.chpc.net) to find and apply to LIHTC and project‑based properties. [affordablehomes.chpc](https://affordablehomes.chpc.net)

7. **Maintain Documentation and Follow‑Ups**  
   - Keep copies of your documents, track applications and case workers’ contact information, and check in regularly with your CES access point, county worker, and PHAs. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

## Section 8: Document Checklist

Having your paperwork ready can speed up housing placements and reduce delays. Many programs in California will ask for:  

- **Photo ID** (state ID, driver’s license, or other government ID).  
- **Social Security cards** or proof of having applied.  
- **Income proof** (pay stubs, award letters for SSI/SSDI, CalWORKs, General Relief, unemployment, etc.).  
- **Homeless verification letter** from a shelter, outreach worker, or agency, or documentation of staying in places not meant for habitation. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)
- **Disability verification** (for HDAP, SSI/SSDI applications, or supportive housing) – medical records or forms completed by a licensed provider. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)
- **Eviction notices** (3‑day, 30‑day, unlawful detainer paperwork) to prove risk of homelessness, which can be used for programs like CalWORKs HA and prevention funding. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
- **Birth certificates** for children in the household (often needed for CalWORKs, BFH, and some housing programs). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)

If you are missing documents, tell your worker; many programs can help you obtain replacements or give temporary approvals while you gather records.

## Section 9: Timeline Reality Check

### Shelter and Interim Housing

Shelter beds, bridge housing, and motel programs depend on local capacity and funding. In some areas there are frequent openings; in others, shelters are full and people wait days or weeks for a spot. Some state and county programs (like motel vouchers) have strict limits (for example, HA’s 16‑day limit) so you must plan for what comes next from day one. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)

[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)

### Rapid Rehousing and Permanent Supportive Housing

Rapid rehousing slots and permanent supportive housing units are limited and are often reserved for those with the highest vulnerability scores or specific eligibility (chronic homelessness, disability, veterans). It can take months or longer after your CES assessment before you receive a referral, and many people are never matched because demand is higher than supply. [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/docs/gpp/california-provider/CA_CAID_HomelessCoordinatedEntrySystems.pdf?v=202411131531)

[Citations] [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/docs/gpp/california-provider/CA_CAID_HomelessCoordinatedEntrySystems.pdf?v=202411131531)

### Section 8 and Affordable Housing

Section 8 waitlists in California can be closed for long periods, and when they open, they may receive tens of thousands of applications for a small number of slots; actual wait times can range from 1 year to over 10 years in some areas. Affordable housing properties also maintain their own waitlists, which can range from a few months to many years depending on location and unit size. [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)

Because of these realities, the best strategy is to treat housing as a long‑term process, keep your name on as many appropriate lists as possible, and use interim resources (shelters, rapid rehousing, county subsidies) to stay housed while you wait.  

[Citations] [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)

## Section 10: Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoiding these mistakes can protect your spot on waitlists and improve your chances of being housed.  

1. **Waiting for one program only**  
   - Relying on Section 8 alone or just one shelter program can leave you stuck for years; you should be in CES, county programs, and multiple waitlists at the same time. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

2. **Not applying in multiple counties or cities when possible**  
   - Many PHAs and affordable properties in different counties have their own waitlists; you may be able to apply to several even if you don’t live there yet, depending on local preference rules. [affordablehomes.chpc](https://affordablehomes.chpc.net)

3. **Not updating your contact information**  
   - PHAs and property managers often send notices by mail or email; if they can’t reach you, they may remove you from the waitlist. Always update your address, phone, and email with CES, DPSS, and every housing provider where you applied. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)

4. **Missing document deadlines or appointments**  
   - Many programs have strict timelines; missing an appointment or failing to turn in documents can close your case or move you down the list. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)

5. **Not opening mail or ignoring unfamiliar numbers**  
   - Housing authorities and agencies may call from blocked or unfamiliar numbers and send important letters that look generic. Open all mail, keep a folder for housing letters, and check voicemail regularly.  

6. **Not asking questions when you don’t understand**  
   - Programs can be confusing; ask your case worker, shelter staff, or legal aid to explain your options, appeal rights, and what to expect next. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)

## Conclusion: Moving from Shelter to Stable Housing in California

There is no one form that takes you straight from a shelter bed into Section 8, and most Californians will move through a mix of shelters, county programs, rapid rehousing, and multiple waitlists before they reach permanent housing. Coordinated Entry is often required for referrals to rapid rehousing, bridge housing, and permanent supportive housing, while county programs like CalWORKs HSP, HA, and HDAP can provide the temporary boost you need to get into a unit and stay there long enough to stabilize. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)

The system is slow and far from perfect, but many people do make it to stable housing by using a layered strategy: staying connected to CES, applying for all available benefits, getting on every appropriate waitlist, and protecting their rights with legal help when needed. With persistence, organization, and support, you can move step by step from crisis shelter toward a permanent home. [stayhousedla](https://www.stayhousedla.org)
