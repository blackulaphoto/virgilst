If you are reading this, you are already doing something very brave: looking for information and options. You are not alone, and there are real people and programs in California ready to help you stay safer, find housing, and rebuild your life. 

***

## SECTION 1: IF YOU ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

If you believe you or your children are in immediate danger, treat this as an emergency.

- Call 911 from any phone. You can ask for police and say: “I am experiencing domestic violence and I’m afraid for my safety.”  
- If you can’t safely talk, in many places you can leave the line open and the dispatcher may send help if they hear disturbance; you can also say “Yes/No” or short phrases like “send police.” Responses can vary by county, so stay on the line as long as it’s safe.

### National Domestic Violence Hotline (24/7, confidential, all genders)

The National Domestic Violence Hotline can help you with safety planning, emotional support, and referrals anywhere in California. Services are free and confidential. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)

- Phone: **1‑800‑799‑SAFE (1‑800‑799‑7233)** [acf](https://acf.gov/acf-hotlines-helplines)
- TTY: **1‑800‑787‑3224** [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)
- Text: **Text “START” to 88788** [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)
- Online chat: **https://www.thehotline.org** (click “Chat Now”) [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)

You can tell them if you are in California, if you are LGBTQ+, undocumented, disabled, or a parent; they can help find local resources that respect your situation. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)

### Safety planning basics (quick version)

A safety plan is a personalized plan to reduce risk when things escalate, when you leave, and after you leave. Hotlines and local advocates can help you build one in detail, but here are basics: [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)

- Identify safe rooms and exits (rooms with doors and windows, away from weapons).  
- Keep a small go‑bag where you can grab it quickly: IDs, birth certificates, Social Security numbers, bank cards, immigration documents, medications, keys, phone charger, a change of clothes, and important numbers written on paper.  
- Teach children simple safety steps: how to call 911, a code word that means “go to a safe place,” and who they can run to (neighbor, store, school).  
- Plan how you would leave quickly (where you’d go first: friend, shelter, hospital, police station).  

A hotline advocate can walk through this with you step by step, including for people who must use mobility devices, have chronic illness, or depend financially on the abuser. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)

### Technology safety tips

Abusers often misuse technology to monitor, stalk, or harass. National DV Hotline offers technology safety guidance.  Basic steps: [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)

- Assume your phone, email, or social media **could** be monitored until proven otherwise.  
- Whenever possible, use a safer device your partner cannot access (a friend’s phone, library computer, or work device) for searching for help, changing passwords, or contacting services. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
- Change passwords and PINs (email, banking, social media, cloud backups) on a safe device; use passcodes your partner cannot guess.  
- Turn off location sharing in apps (Find My, Google Maps, Snapchat, Life360); check Bluetooth devices and unknown apps.  
- If your partner has access to your phone plan, they might see call/text history; consider using hotlines’ chat or text from a different device. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)
- After you get to safety, ask an advocate about checking for stalkerware/spyware.

The California courts and DV sites also remind survivors that website history can show up to an abuser, and they encourage clearing browser history and using “private” or “incognito” windows when you search for help. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)

### Confidential shelter options

Domestic violence shelters in California typically provide: [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)

- Safe, confidential locations.  
- Beds for adults and children; many shelters accept men, LGBTQ+ survivors, and people with disabilities. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)
- Case management, safety planning, help with restraining orders, and referrals for housing and legal aid. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)
- Basic needs: food, clothing, hygiene items. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)

Ways to access shelter:

- Call the **National Domestic Violence Hotline** (1‑800‑799‑7233) and ask for DV shelter referrals in your county. [acf](https://acf.gov/acf-hotlines-helplines)
- Call your local 211 to be connected with DV shelters and homeless services (see Section 3). [211ca](https://211ca.org)
- In Los Angeles, Orange, or San Diego Counties, you can also call the regional DV hotlines and shelters listed in Sections 4–6 for direct intake. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)

## SECTION 2: FIRST 72 HOURS AFTER ABUSE

You might feel shock, numbness, guilt, or confusion. All of those reactions are normal trauma responses. During the first 72 hours, focus on safety and preserving options for the future.

### Medical care and documentation

Even if you don’t have visible injuries, it’s often wise to see a doctor, urgent care, or emergency room. Medical records can serve as evidence later and help keep you safer. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

- Tell the provider you experienced domestic violence so they can document injuries and note your concerns.  
- Ask for copies of medical records or discharge papers; keep them in a safe place or with a trusted person. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)
- If you were strangled (even without marks), have headaches, confusion, or vision changes, seek emergency care immediately—strangulation can be life‑threatening. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)

You can ask a DV advocate to help you get to a clinic or hospital; many shelters and county programs help with transportation. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)

### Restraining orders in California (how and where to file)

In California, a **Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO)** is a civil court order that can order an abuser to stop abuse, stay away, move out, and follow other rules; it can also address child custody and support. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

- The California Courts Self‑Help site has a step‑by‑step guide: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
- LawHelpCA also has plain‑language guides on domestic violence restraining orders: https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

Typical steps: [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

1. Get the forms:  
   - From your county superior court’s self‑help center or website, or online at the California Courts site. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
2. Fill them out:  
   - Include specific incidents, dates (if you can), injuries, threats, and include children or household members who also need protection. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)
3. Turn them in (“file”):  
   - File at the family law clerk’s office in your county. There is usually **no filing fee** for DVROs. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
4. Temporary order:  
   - A judge usually reviews your request the same or next business day and may grant a **Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)** that lasts until your court hearing (usually within weeks). [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
5. Service:  
   - Someone 18 or older, **not you**, must hand‑deliver the papers to the abuser (“serve” them). Sheriffs in many counties will serve DVROs for free. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)
6. Hearing:  
   - At the hearing, the judge decides whether to give a longer‑term order that can last up to 5 years. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

Local DV advocates and legal aid can help you fill out forms, ask for custody and support orders, and prepare for court. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence.html)

### Evidence preservation

You do not have to decide right now whether to report to police or go to court. But preserving evidence gives you options. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

- Save photos of injuries, damaged property, weapons, and screenshots of threatening texts, emails, or social media; back them up to a secure cloud account or trusted friend’s device.  
- Keep a simple incident log: dates, what happened, witnesses, and what children saw or heard.  
- Save medical records, police reports, and any prior restraining orders. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
- Do not edit or delete abusive messages if you might use them in court; instead, screenshot and then consider blocking if needed for safety.  

Hotline and local advocates can help you think about what evidence is most helpful and how to store it safely. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

### Talking to children about safety

Children may see or hear more than you realize. It’s not your fault, and you can still help them feel safer. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)

- Use simple, age‑appropriate language: “What is happening is not okay. It is not your fault. My job is to keep us safe.”  
- Teach them:  
  - Where they can go in the house to stay safer (away from violence).  
  - How to call 911 (if it’s safe in your situation) and what to say.  
  - A code word that means “go to the safe place” or “call for help.”  
- Reassure them that many families get help, and they can talk to a counselor or advocate too. Many DV shelters provide children’s counseling and support groups. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)

### Temporary safe housing options

Within the first 72 hours, you might need immediate shelter:

- **DV emergency shelters**: confidential, often 30–45 days; they provide safety, case management, legal and benefits advocacy, and support groups. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)
- **Friends/family**: If this is your plan, discuss safety (no sharing your exact location with the abuser, blocking social media check‑ins).  
- **Hotels/motels**: Some county programs (especially through CalWORKs Homeless Assistance) can help with short‑term motel stays when homelessness is due to domestic violence. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)

To find safe housing quickly:

- Call the National DV Hotline (1‑800‑799‑7233). [acf](https://acf.gov/acf-hotlines-helplines)
- Call 211 in your county (see Section 3). [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)
- Call county‑specific DV shelters and hotlines listed in Sections 4–6. [a77.asmdc](https://a77.asmdc.org/resources-survivors-domestic-violence)

### How to contact local DV advocates

Domestic violence advocates can sit with you (in person or by phone), talk through your options, help with restraining orders, and connect you to housing and benefits. [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)

- Use the **National DV Hotline**’s provider directory: https://www.thehotline.org – click “Get Help” then “Find Local Resources” (directory link). [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)
- Use **California Partnership to End Domestic Violence**’s “Find Help” page to locate DV organizations by county: https://www.cpedv.org (navigate to resources for survivors). [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)
- Use **LawHelpCA** to search for “domestic violence” and your county for legal aid and survivor services: https://www.lawhelpca.org [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

## SECTION 3: HOW TO FIND HELP IN YOUR COUNTY

### How 211 works in California

**211** is a free, confidential service that connects you to local resources 24/7, including DV shelters, legal help, food, and housing. [ocwomenshealth](https://www.ocwomenshealth.org/resources/dv)

- Dial **2‑1‑1** from any phone in most California counties.  
- Or visit **https://211ca.org** and enter your ZIP code to connect with your local 211. [211ca](https://211ca.org)
- Services are available in multiple languages and are open to everyone, including undocumented people and LGBTQ+ survivors. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)

In Orange County, you can also use **211OC** directly at https://211oc.org. [211oc](https://211oc.org)

When you call, you can say, “I am experiencing domestic violence and I need confidential shelter and legal/housing resources.”

### Coordinated Entry for DV survivors

Many California communities use “Coordinated Entry” to connect people experiencing homelessness to shelter, transitional housing, and rapid rehousing. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)

For domestic violence survivors:

- There is often a **separate, confidential pathway** for DV survivors so your information is not shared broadly through the general homeless system. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)
- 211 or a DV hotline typically does a **screening** to see if you should be referred through the DV‑specific Coordinated Entry system (for example, to DV shelters or DV‑specific rapid rehousing). [211ca](https://211ca.org)

Tell them clearly you are a **survivor of domestic violence** and you are concerned about confidentiality.

### How to request confidential shelter

When you call a hotline, 211, or shelter:

- Start with safety: “Is this a confidential line?” (Most DV hotlines are.) [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)
- Say only what you are comfortable sharing at first; you can give more details as you feel safer.  
- You do **not** have to prove abuse on the phone; they will ask questions to understand risk and match you with appropriate services. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)

If they are full, ask:

- “Do you know another DV shelter that might have space?”  
- “Is there a DV‑specific motel voucher or homeless program I can be referred to?” (Especially if you are or may be eligible for CalWORKs.) [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)

### What information you’ll likely need

It’s okay if you don’t have everything, but having some of this ready can help:

- Your first name (you may be able to use a nickname if needed for safety).  
- Number of adults and children needing shelter, ages, and any special needs or disabilities. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)
- Whether the abuser knows your car, phone, or usual routes.  
- Whether you have pets (some shelters are pet‑friendly or work with pet foster programs).  
- Any urgent medical or mental health needs.  

You can ask, “What information do you actually need, and what can I leave out for safety?”

### What happens during intake

Intake is the process where a hotline or shelter gathers information and decides if they can offer you a bed or other help. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)

- You talk with an advocate who asks about safety, recent incidents, children, and any health needs.  
- If they have space, they’ll explain how to get there; locations are usually kept confidential, and you might meet staff at a neutral spot first. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)
- If they’re full, they may call other shelters with you, refer you to motel vouchers, or put you on a waiting list. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)
- Once you arrive, you’ll sign confidentiality and house agreements and meet with a case manager to talk about housing, legal options, benefits, and safety planning. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)

## SECTION 7: LEGAL PROTECTIONS & YOUR RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA

You have legal rights in California as a survivor of domestic violence, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or immigration status.

### Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs)

DVROs can: [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

- Order the abuser not to contact, harass, or threaten you.  
- Require them to stay a certain distance away from you, your home, job, or children’s school.  
- Order them to move out of your shared home.  
- Prohibit them from owning firearms.  
- Include child custody, visitation, and support orders; sometimes spousal support as well.  

Resources:

- California Courts DVRO guide: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
- LawHelpCA explanation of DVROs: https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

### Tenant protections and housing discrimination

California law offers protections for tenants experiencing domestic violence, including the right to: 

- Ask your landlord to change locks quickly if you provide proof of a protective order or police report in many circumstances (under state landlord‑tenant statutes). [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)
- In some cases, break a lease early because of domestic violence with proper documentation, without typical penalties (state civil code provisions on DV and leases). [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)
- Be free from housing discrimination based on being a victim of domestic violence, especially in subsidized housing and under certain fair housing laws. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

Because details change, use LawHelpCA and local legal aid to get the latest on tenant protections and how they apply in your situation. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

### Safe at Home – California Address Confidentiality Program

**Safe at Home** is California’s statewide confidential address program, run by the Secretary of State. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home)

- Website: **https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home** [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/frequently-asked-questions)
- It provides a **substitute mailing address** and mail forwarding for survivors of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, elder/dependent abuse, and some others. [amadorcounty](https://www.amadorcounty.gov/government/elections/safe-at-home)
- The program can help keep your home address out of many public records and can be used with certain government agencies, voter registration, and sometimes property records. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/frequently-asked-questions)
- Participants may also access added protections like DMV records suppression and the ability to petition for a confidential name change related to domestic violence. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/frequently-asked-questions)

Safe at Home is most effective as part of a broader safety plan, and a DV advocate can help you apply. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSuUcF98Us)

### Employment protections for DV survivors in California

California law protects workers who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and other qualifying acts of violence. These protections have been expanding, including through **AB 406** (effective late 2025 and 2026). [cdflaborlaw](https://www.cdflaborlaw.com/blog/key-new-2026-employment-laws-for-california-employers)

Key protections include:

- Employers may **not retaliate or discriminate** against you because you are a victim or because a family member is a victim, if the employer knows about it. [legiscan](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB406/id/3259530)
- You may have the right to **take time off** (paid or unpaid, depending on policy) to:  
  - Seek medical attention.  
  - Get a restraining order or other crime‑related relief.  
  - Attend court hearings or meet with prosecutors.  
  - Seek services from DV shelters, counselors, or victim advocates. [ogletree](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/california-expands-leave-and-protections-for-victims-of-violence/)
- Employers must provide **reasonable safety accommodations**, such as schedule changes, transfers, locks on doors, changes in work phone or location, or other measures to keep you safer at work. [legiscan](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB406/id/3259530)
- You may use paid sick leave (“safe time”) for certain crime‑related absences. [spencerfane](https://www.spencerfane.com/insight/golden-state-gotchas-your-2026-california-employment-law-guide/)

If your employer violates these rights, you can contact legal aid or the California Civil Rights Department (through LawHelpCA for referrals). [ogletree](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/california-expands-leave-and-protections-for-victims-of-violence/)

## SECTION 8: HOUSING PATHWAY FOR DV SURVIVORS

Housing after leaving an abusive relationship often unfolds in stages. You might move through one or several of these.

### Emergency shelter

Emergency DV shelter is usually the first step for many survivors who cannot safely stay where they are. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)

- Length of stay often runs around 30–45 days; policies vary by agency. [ocfjcfoundation](https://www.ocfjcfoundation.org/dv-shelters/)
- Services: safety planning, legal advocacy, help with benefits and CalWORKs, counseling, and housing search planning. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)
- Access: through DV hotlines, 211, and sometimes law enforcement or hospitals. [211ca](https://211ca.org)

### Transitional housing

Transitional housing gives more time (months to up to 2 years in some programs) to stabilize work and healing. [ocfjcfoundation](https://www.ocfjcfoundation.org/dv-shelters/)

- Some DV agencies in LA, Orange, and San Diego Counties offer transitional housing specifically for DV survivors (for example, programs linked to 1736, Laura’s House, Human Options, and YWCA). [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)
- Residents usually work on savings plans, employment, and longer‑term housing. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)

### Rapid rehousing (RRH)

Rapid rehousing helps you move into your own unit more quickly through short‑ to medium‑term rental assistance and case management.

- Many communities have **DV‑specific rapid rehousing** funded by state and federal programs, accessed through DV agencies or coordinated entry. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)
- 211 or your DV case manager can tell you if there is DV rapid rehousing in your county and how to be referred. [211ca](https://211ca.org)

### CalWORKs Homeless Assistance (for eligible families)

If you are a parent with low income, you may qualify for **CalWORKs** (California’s cash aid program) and its **Homeless Assistance (HA)** component. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)

- CalWORKs Homeless Assistance can provide:  
  - Payments for temporary shelter (for example, motel stays) for up to **16 days**, once every 12 months (with some exceptions). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
  - Help with security deposit and last month’s rent or rent arrears to obtain or keep permanent housing. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
- Families fleeing domestic violence can be treated as homeless for CalWORKs HA eligibility based on their sworn statement, even if the abuser has income or assets. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)

Resources:

- CDSS CalWORKs Homeless Assistance info: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)
- LA County CalWORKs Homeless Programs & Services: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)

Ask your county welfare office or DV liaison: “I’m fleeing domestic violence—can I get CalWORKs and Homeless Assistance?”

### Section 8 and longer‑term housing

- If you already have a **Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher** or other subsidized housing, you may have rights to emergency transfers or portability because of domestic violence under federal and state protections. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)
- If you don’t have a voucher, you can ask housing authorities and DV agencies if there are waitlist preferences or set‑asides for DV survivors. Policies vary by county and housing authority. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

Use LawHelpCA or a local legal aid/housing advocate to understand your specific rights with your landlord or voucher. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)

### Safety planning for housing searches

When you look for housing:

- Consider distance from the abuser’s home, work, and family; think about bus routes and shared communities.  
- Ask about building security (locks, cameras, secure entry); talk to your employer about keeping your work address confidential. [legiscan](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB406/id/3259530)
- Ask an advocate if Safe at Home could protect your address in public records. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home)
- Avoid putting your precise address on public online rental platforms; use email or P.O. box where possible.

## SECTION 9: HEALING AFTER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

Leaving or surviving abuse is not just a legal or housing process; it’s an emotional and physical healing journey.

### Trauma responses: fight, flight, freeze, fawn

Many survivors notice they reacted in ways they don’t fully understand. Common trauma responses include:

- **Fight**: arguing back, defending yourself, feeling intense anger.  
- **Flight**: wanting to run away, avoiding, overworking, or constantly staying busy.  
- **Freeze**: feeling numb, unable to move or speak, forgetting details, “going blank.”  
- **Fawn**: trying to appease or please the abuser to survive, saying “yes” to things you don’t want, minimizing your own needs.  

These responses are **survival strategies**, not character flaws. Trauma‑informed counselors and DV advocates normalize and work gently with these patterns. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)

### Counseling options

You deserve support that fits your identity and story.

- Many DV agencies (Laura’s House, Human Options, Peace Over Violence, YWCA, etc.) offer free or low‑cost individual counseling, support groups, and trauma‑focused therapy. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)
- Some offer specialized services for LGBTQ+ survivors, men, undocumented survivors, and survivors with disabilities. [domesticshelters](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help/ca/los-angeles)
- You can ask 211 or the National DV Hotline to help you find a trauma‑informed therapist who understands domestic violence. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)

If you have Medi‑Cal or other insurance, ask your plan for behavioral health providers with experience in trauma and domestic violence.

### Support groups

Support groups can reduce isolation and shame.

- Most DV organizations in LA, Orange, and San Diego counties offer in‑person or virtual support groups, some in Spanish and other languages. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)
- Groups might focus on parenting after DV, LGBTQ+ survivors, immigrant survivors, or long‑term healing. [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)

You can ask, “Do you have groups for my specific situation?” (for example, male survivors, non‑binary survivors, parents, or survivors with chronic illness).

### Rebuilding identity and boundaries

Abuse often attacks your sense of self and your ability to say “no.”

- Working with counselors and advocates, you can explore what **you** like, believe, and want, separate from the abuser. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)
- Boundaries can start small: choosing who you respond to, how quickly, and what topics you’re willing to discuss.  
- Many DV programs have empowerment classes (like Personal Empowerment Programs at Laura’s House) focused on rebuilding self‑worth and healthy relationship skills. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)

### Financial recovery steps

Financial abuse is extremely common—controlling money, sabotaging work, or forcing debt.

Steps you can explore:

- Open a new bank account in your own name at a different bank or credit union, if it’s safe.  
- Pull your free credit report and look for accounts you don’t recognize.  
- Ask DV advocates and legal aid about:  
  - Removing the abuser from certain debts where possible.  
  - Debt collection rights and protections if you are a DV survivor.  
- If you have low income and children, apply for **CalWORKs**, CalFresh (food benefits), and other programs; DV liaisons can help you navigate safely. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)

### Long‑term stability planning

Over time, your plan can expand beyond crisis survival:

- Stable housing: working toward transitional or permanent housing with or without subsidies. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)
- Education and career: using job training, GED/college programs, or workforce development; some DV agencies partner with job programs. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence.html)
- Ongoing emotional support: continuing therapy, peer support groups, or mentoring. [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)
- Legal stability: finalizing custody, support, divorce, or immigration cases with help from legal aid. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

Healing is not linear. It’s normal to have setbacks; staying connected to supportive people and services makes a big difference.

## SECTION 10: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

No one is perfect in a crisis, and you are doing the best you can. These are common pitfalls that can make things harder later; knowing them lets you plan around them.

### Going back without a safety plan

Many survivors leave and return multiple times; this is common and often related to safety, finances, or children.

- If you think you might return, talk with an advocate first about a safety plan for returning and leaving again if needed. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)
- A safety plan can cover where to hide documents, how to teach children warning signs, and how to keep contact with advocates even if you go back. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)

### Not documenting abuse

You might feel tempted to forget and move on, but documentation can protect you later.

- Try to keep a simple written log, photos, and screenshots in a safe place. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)
- Ask medical providers to record that injuries are related to domestic violence. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)

### Isolating completely

You might feel ashamed or afraid of burdening others.

- Reach out to at least one safe person or a hotline; isolation can make you more vulnerable to going back or staying in danger. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)

### Not updating address with key agencies (safely)

If you move:

- Update your address with the court (for your case), legal aid, benefits offices, and schools so you don’t miss notices—but ask about confidential addresses where possible. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home)
- Consider Safe at Home if you’re moving and want more address privacy. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSuUcF98Us)

### Missing court deadlines

Court paperwork and hearings can feel overwhelming.

- Put all deadlines in one place (calendar, phone reminders, notebook).  
- Ask legal aid, DV legal advocates, or court self‑help centers to help track your case. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)

If you miss a hearing, contact the court or a legal aid office as soon as you can; sometimes there are ways to fix or reschedule. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)
