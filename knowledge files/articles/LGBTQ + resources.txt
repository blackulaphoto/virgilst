A) FAST START (READ THIS FIRST)  

If you’re in crisis in California, start with these five moves. You can do them from a phone, shelter lobby, library, or hospital waiting room.  

1. Call 211 to find a safe place to sleep and basic help  
   - Dial 2-1-1 from any phone or visit https://211ca.org to be routed to your local 211. [211ca](https://211ca.org)
   - In Los Angeles County, you can also call 2-1-1 or 800-339-6993 or use https://211la.org. [211la](https://211la.org/homeless-housing-support-programs)
   - Tell them: “I am LGBTQ+, I’m currently homeless/at risk, and I need emergency shelter or motel placement and help getting into housing programs.” [211la](https://211la.org/homeless-housing-support-programs)

2. Contact an LGBTQ+ center for intake, case management, and safer services  
   - Los Angeles: Los Angeles LGBT Center, 323-993-7400, housing info at https://lalgbtcenter.org/services/housing. [lalgbtcenter](https://lalgbtcenter.org/services/housing/)

   - Ask for: “intake or case management for housing, benefits, and employment; I’m LGBTQ+ and need affirming services.” [sfcenter](https://www.sfcenter.org/program/housing-financial/)

3. If you are escaping family violence, partner abuse, or trafficking  
   - Call 211 and say “I need domestic violence shelter and I am LGBTQ+.” Many DV programs and 211 lists can connect you to confidential shelters and safety planning. [211](http://www.211.org)
   - If you’re in immediate danger or seriously hurt, call 911. If calling 911 doesn’t feel safe, consider 988 for crisis counseling and safety planning. [sandiegocounty](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/bhs/ACL.html)

4. For urgent HIV, PEP/PrEP, or lost medications  
   - PEP (post-exposure) must start within 72 hours after a possible HIV exposure; PrEP helps prevent HIV before exposure and is covered under Medi-Cal when medically necessary. [ryanwhite.hrsa](https://ryanwhite.hrsa.gov/about/parts-and-initiatives/part-b-adap)

B) HOUSING & SHELTER (LGBTQ+ FRIENDLY)  

How California’s housing access system works  
- 211 and county hotlines are usually the front door for shelter, motel vouchers, and connection to your local Coordinated Entry System (CES). [211ca](https://211ca.org)
- Coordinated Entry is how counties match people experiencing homelessness to limited slots in shelter, bridge housing, rapid rehousing, or permanent supportive housing; you usually need an intake/assessment to get on the list. [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)
- HUD-funded programs (including vouchers and supportive housing) run through local public housing agencies (PHAs) and homelessness systems; you can find PHAs and HUD-funded programs through HUD’s online resource and PHA locators. [ryanwhite.hrsa](https://ryanwhite.hrsa.gov/about/parts-and-initiatives/part-b-adap)

Key entry points  

1. 211 California (statewide)  
- Call 2-1-1 or go to https://211ca.org to search for “emergency shelter,” “transitional housing,” or “LGBTQ+ shelter.” [211ca](https://211ca.org/search/?category=BH-8600&search=Transitional+Housing%2FShelter)
- 211 can connect you to local programs, DV shelters, and sometimes motel vouchers. [211la](https://211la.org/homeless-housing-support-programs)

- LA’s CES includes LGBTQ+ providers such as the LA LGBT Center as core partners. [211la](https://211la.org/homeless-housing-support-programs)

3. Alameda County (example for Bay Area CES)  
- Alameda County Coordinated Entry information: https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page. [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)

Workplace discrimination  
- ACLU of Southern California notes that California law bans discrimination based on actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in employment. [aclusocal](https://www.aclusocal.org/know-your-rights/california-lgbtq-employment-rights/)
- If you experience harassment, wrongful termination, or discrimination at work because you are LGBTQ+, you can contact your local ACLU affiliate and/or file with CRD’s employment division. [aclusocal](https://www.aclusocal.org/know-your-rights/california-lgbtq-employment-rights/)

Immigration and LGBTQ+  
- LawHelpCA lists nonprofit immigration legal providers, including those experienced with LGBTQ+ asylum, U visas for DV survivors, and other protections. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help/directory/area)

I) PATHWAY MAP: FROM CRISIS TO STABILITY  

1) Safety + emergency shelter  
- First 24–72 hours: focus on where you can safely sleep and how to avoid immediate harm.  
- Call 211, local LGBTQ+ centers, and DV hotlines to get into emergency shelter, youth housing, DV shelter, or motel vouchers if available. [211ca](https://211ca.org)

2) ID + benefits setup  
- Within the first 1–2 weeks, work with case managers at shelters, LGBTQ+ centers, or outreach programs to replace ID and apply for benefits.  
- Use BenefitsCal to apply for Medi-Cal, CalFresh, and CalWORKs; these programs can stabilize food and health coverage while you focus on housing and work. [sonomacounty](https://sonomacounty.gov/health-and-human-services/human-services/apply-online-at-benefitscal)

3) Medical stabilization (HIV care, mental health, SUD treatment)  
- Once you have at least temporary shelter or a regular place to check in, connect with HIV/sexual health clinics, county behavioral health access lines, and SUD treatment programs.  
- Ask for LGBTQ+ competent providers where possible; LA LGBT Center, APLA Health, AHF, and county clinics can coordinate HIV care, mental health, and substance use support. [dmh.lacounty](https://dmh.lacounty.gov/our-services/disaster-services/access-hotline/)

4) Housing navigation (CES + housing programs)  
- Complete Coordinated Entry assessments with outreach teams or access points; make sure your LGBTQ+ identity and health needs (including HIV, disability, and DV) are recorded so they can prioritize you appropriately. [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)
- Stay in regular contact with your housing navigator and update them if your situation worsens (e.g., sleeping outside, safety threats). [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)

5) Income (employment + training)  
- When you have some stability, connect with AJCCs or LGBTQ+ center employment programs for job search, training, and placement support. [sfcenter](https://sfcenter.org)
- Focus first on income that keeps you stably housed (even if it’s not your dream job), then look at longer-term training. [ajcc.lacounty](https://www.ajcc.lacounty.gov/ajcc)

6) Long-term housing (vouchers, affordable housing, supportive housing)  
- Work with case managers and housing navigators to apply for vouchers, project-based units, or supportive housing that fits your needs (e.g., HIV supportive housing, youth housing, or permanent supportive housing). [211la](https://211la.org/homeless-housing-support-programs)
- Use SF LGBT Center’s financial counseling or similar services to plan for rent, debt, and credit, so you can keep housing once you get it. [sfcenter](https://www.sfcenter.org/community/how-the-center-helps-lgbtq-families-achieve-their-dreams/)

J) COMMON PITFALLS (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM)  

1) Not asking for LGBTQ+-competent case management  
- Many systems will not automatically connect you with affirming providers; you have to ask.  
- When you call 211, clinics, or shelters, say: “I am LGBTQ+ and would like an affirming case manager or provider if possible.” [lalgbtcenter](https://lalgbtcenter.org/services/sexual-health-services/)

2) Not documenting discrimination or mistreatment  
- If a shelter, landlord, or employer discriminates against you, write down dates, names, what was said, and any witnesses.  
- This record helps when you contact Lambda Legal, NCLR, ACLU, or the Civil Rights Department to enforce your rights. [lambdalegal](https://lambdalegal.org/contact/)

3) Missing waitlist mail or losing contact  
- Housing programs often send letters or call once; if they can’t reach you, they may drop your spot.  
- Use a stable mailing address (LGBTQ+ center, shelter, or PO box) and voicemail greeting, and check in regularly with your housing navigator. [sfcenter](https://www.sfcenter.org/program/housing-financial/)

4) Not updating contact info  
- Whenever you change phones, emails, or addresses, immediately update 211 referrals, case managers, clinics, and housing programs.  
- You can usually update contact info by calling the program front desk or your county access line. [dmh.lacounty](https://dmh.lacounty.gov/get-help-now/)

5) Thinking “one application solves everything”  
- In California, you often need multiple applications: BenefitsCal for benefits, CES intake for housing, clinic intake for medical, AJCC intake for jobs, and separate legal intakes. [sonomacounty](https://sonomacounty.gov/health-and-human-services/human-services/apply-online-at-benefitscal)
- Build a simple list (on paper or in your phone) of: which programs you applied to, dates, contact names, and when to follow up. [sfcenter](https://www.sfcenter.org/program/housing-financial/)
