Who This Is For

Emergency Services at URM are designed for people who:

    Are currently unhoused or in unsafe, unstable living conditions (streets, vehicles, encampments, couch-surfing, unsafe motels).​​

    Need immediate access to food, shelter, showers, or basic care and are in the Skid Row / downtown Los Angeles area.​​

    May have untreated medical or mental health needs, substance use issues, or legal barriers but are not yet ready or able to enter a longer-term recovery or transitional program.​

    Include: single men, single women, and families with children; URM is one of the few missions on Skid Row that keeps families together in shelter.

There is no requirement to be sober on arrival, but dangerous or disruptive behavior (violence, weapons, open drug/alcohol use inside) can affect access to services.​​
Meals: What You Can Access Today

URM serves approximately 3,000 warm meals per day, three times daily.​​

What is offered

    Breakfast, lunch, and dinner served onsite in the dining area.
    ​

    Hot, prepared meals with basic nutrition; menus vary and may include protein, starch, vegetables, and beverages.​

    Some meals are available both to overnight guests and walk-in day guests, subject to daily capacity.​​

Who qualifies

    People experiencing homelessness or extreme poverty in the Skid Row area.​​

    Families, single adults, and older youth; there are typically no geographic restrictions.​​

Cost

    Meals are provided free of charge to guests.​​

How to access meals (same day)

    Go to URM Downtown Ministry at 545 S. San Pedro St, LA, CA 90013.​

    Arrive ahead of posted meal times; exact schedules can change, so check at the front desk or call (213) 347-6300 for current meal times.

    Follow staff instructions for meal lines and seating; priority may be given to overnight guests, families, older adults, or those with health needs.​​

Shelter: Beds and Day Rooms

URM offers shelter for more than 1,300 men, women, and children, with no outside referral required.​​

Types of shelter

    Night shelter dorms for single men and women.​​

    Family emergency shelter for parents with children (separate section, more privacy and child-focused support).​

    Day rooms that provide daytime rest, seating, and a safe place off the streets.

Who qualifies

    Adults and families experiencing homelessness who can safely stay in a congregate shelter environment.​​

    Families with minor children seeking to stay together in a single facility.​​

    Some beds and floors may be gender-specific; families are placed together in family areas.​​

How long you can stay

    Emergency night shelter is generally short-term, often night-to-night with sign-ups each day; the exact length depends on space, behavior, and program fit.​​

    Families in Family Emergency Services (F.E.S.) can typically stay at least six months while working with a case manager and following program guidelines.​

    Guests who demonstrate stability and interest in next steps may be invited to apply for longer-term programs such as S.E.S., Emmaus Recovery, or Damascus Road.​

Personal Care Services

URM provides basic personal care to support health, dignity, and safety.​​

Available services

    Hot showers for men, women, and families.​​

    Hygiene supplies (soap, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, menstrual products) as available.​

    Diapers and infant care supplies for families with babies and toddlers.​

    Laundry facilities and help with washing clothes, subject to schedules and availability.​​

    Access to clean clothing and donated items when available.​​

How to access

    Check in at the front desk to learn the current schedule for showers and laundry.​

    Staff may give you a time slot, wristband, or ticket depending on capacity and gender-specific scheduling.​

    Families with young children or people with mobility issues may be prioritized for limited slots.​

How Intake Works (Emergency Services)

For basic emergency services (meals, day rooms, some personal care), intake can often be same-day and relatively simple. For overnight shelter and program enrollment, more structured intake is used.​​

Basic walk-in intake

    You may be asked for your name and basic identifying information.​​

    If you have an ID, it can help but is not always required for a first meal or initial contact.​​

    Staff may ask brief questions about your situation (safety concerns, medical issues, children with you) to connect you with the right area.​

Overnight shelter intake

    Daily bed sign-up or check-in times (often late afternoon or evening) are posted at the Mission; times can change, so ask at the front desk or call.

    You may need to complete a brief intake form, including name, date of birth, emergency contact if available, and basic health/safety questions.​

    Staff may perform a quick safety check (bags may be searched; weapons, drugs, and alcohol are generally prohibited inside the facility).​​

Program intake (for recovery / transitional)

    If you’re interested in longer-term programs like S.E.S., F.E.S., Emmaus, or Damascus Road, intake includes more detailed assessments and interviews.​

    Intake staff may schedule a separate appointment to talk about your goals, medical needs, income, and any legal or custody issues.​

Who Qualifies for Emergency Services

Generally eligible

    Adults (18+) and families with children experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles.​​

    People sleeping on the streets, in vehicles, in shelters, in encampments, or in unsafe overcrowded housing.​

    Individuals regardless of religious background; URM is faith-based but services are open to all faiths and to those with no faith.​​

Possible limitations

    Severe medical or psychiatric conditions that require hospital-level care may be referred to emergency departments or specialty facilities.

    Individuals with active violent behavior or serious safety concerns may be limited or redirected for everyone’s safety.​​

    Registered sex offenders or people under certain court orders may face restrictions in some shelter areas due to law or policy; staff can explain options.​

What to Bring

Bringing the right items can make intake and your stay smoother, but you can still access basic services even if you have nothing.

Helpful items

    Any photo ID (driver’s license, state ID, consular ID, passport, student ID, or hospital ID) and Social Security card if available.​

    Important documents: benefits letters, discharge papers, court documents, custody orders, or medical information.​

    A small bag with essential clothing and personal items; URM offers some storage for belongings, especially for S.E.S. participants.​

    Medications in original bottles, including prescriptions for chronic conditions (diabetes, blood pressure, mental health medications).​​

What not to bring

    Weapons, illegal drugs, alcohol, or drug paraphernalia.​​

    Large amounts of cash if you can avoid it; consider storing or protecting valuables separately.​

    Bulky items that cannot be stored; storage is limited and prioritized for program participants.​

Step-by-Step Arrival Process

Below is a realistic same-day process for someone arriving at URM for the first time.

    Travel to URM Downtown Ministry

        Go to 545 S. San Pedro St, Los Angeles, CA 90013.​

        Public transit (buses/Metro) and rideshare are available; many people also arrive on foot from nearby Skid Row streets.​

    Check in at the front entrance / security

        Follow directions from security staff; they may ask you to briefly open bags and walk through a screening process for safety.​​

        Let staff know if you are with children, pregnant, elderly, or have a disability so they can guide you appropriately.​

    Speak with front desk / triage staff

        Share what you need today: food, shower, shelter, or help with medical/legal issues.​

        If you’re seeking a bed tonight, ask specifically about “emergency shelter beds” and “family shelter” (if you have children).​

    Complete basic intake information

        Provide your name and any ID you have; staff may ask brief questions about your health and safety.​

        If English is difficult, ask for help; staff and volunteers may speak multiple languages or help find interpretation.​

    Get directions for the day

        Staff will tell you when and where you can eat, whether you can access a shower or laundry that day, and how to sign up for a bed.​​

        If beds are full, ask about wait lists, overflow options, or return times.​

    Access meals and personal care

        Follow signs and staff directions to the dining hall, showers, and other services.​​

        Keep any ticket or wristband they give you; you may need it for meals or entry to certain areas.​

    Ask about next steps

        If you think you may want a longer-term program (recovery or transitional), tell your caseworker or front desk you are interested in S.E.S., F.E.S., Emmaus, or Damascus Road.​

        They can share basic eligibility and let you know when to come back for an intake or orientation.​

How Long You Can Stay

Emergency shelter

    Often night-to-night, subject to daily sign-ups and capacity.​​

    There is no guaranteed long-term stay in emergency beds, but guests who follow rules and work with staff may remain longer while they explore other options.​

Family Emergency Services (F.E.S.)

    Families are typically able to stay at least six months, as long as they participate in case management and follow program expectations.​

Singles Emergency Services Program (S.E.S.)

    S.E.S. is a one-year program for single adults needing more than basic emergency shelter but not a full recovery program; residents stay onsite during this period.​

Recovery programs

    Damascus Road for women is a one-year residential recovery program at Hope Gardens, with four distinct phases.​

    Emmaus Recovery for men includes a 1-month assessment phase, 6–9 months of intensive recovery, and up to 18 months of apprenticeship housing.​

What To Expect Day to Day (Emergency Level)

    Structured meal times with lines and seating; you may wait outside or in day rooms depending on space.

    Curfew for overnight guests; you must return by specified time to keep your bed.​

    Basic rules around behavior, quiet hours, and respect for staff and other guests.​​

    Regular opportunities to connect with caseworkers, chaplains, and program staff if you want to explore next steps.​

    Optional faith-based activities such as chapel services, prayer, and Bible studies; participation may be strongly encouraged in some programs but emergency services remain open regardless of religious belief.​​

How To Apply or Get Started

For emergency services, you generally do not submit a formal application; you arrive and check in.

Same-day steps

    Call URM: (213) 347-6300 to confirm meal times and bed availability.​

    Go to 545 S. San Pedro St, Los Angeles, CA 90013.​

    Tell staff you are new and need emergency shelter, food, or showers.​

If you are coming with children

    Call ahead if possible to ask specifically about Family Emergency Services (F.E.S.) and family beds.​

    Bring any documents related to your children (birth certificates, custody orders, medical records) if you have them; lack of paperwork should not stop you from seeking help.​

Next steps beyond emergency

    Ask for an appointment with a case manager to discuss S.E.S., F.E.S., or a recovery program once you are ready.​

    Case managers will review eligibility, help with required paperwork, and discuss realistic timelines for program entry and housing.​
