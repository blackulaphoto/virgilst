Who This Is For

Education services are designed for:

    URM guests in emergency shelter (S.E.S., F.E.S.) who want to improve skills to exit homelessness.​

    Participants in Emmaus and Damascus Road recovery programs seeking to rebuild careers or start new ones.​

    Adults who did not finish high school, need to improve English, or want to change careers.​

Most programs have no tuition cost for URM guests; availability of specific courses can depend on staffing and partnerships.​
Adult Basic Education & GED/HiSET Prep

Adult Basic Education (ABE)

    Focuses on reading, writing, and math at foundational levels.​

    Helps learners who may have been out of school for years regain confidence and basic academic skills.​

GED/HiSET preparation

    Structured preparation for high school equivalency exams (GED or HiSET), including practice tests and targeted instruction.​

    Learning Center staff work with LAUSD instructors and adaptive learning software to create individualized study plans.​

Typical pathway

    Initial assessment to determine current reading and math level (e.g., TABE or similar tests).​

    Assignment to classes or tutoring sessions at your level.​

    Gradual progression toward test readiness, followed by referral to official testing centers or partner schools.​

ESL and Computer Literacy

English as a Second Language (ESL)

    Classes for adults whose first language is not English, focusing on conversation, reading, and everyday survival language.​

    Integrated with life skills (e.g., filling out forms, speaking with employers, understanding instructions).​

Computer literacy

    Basic computer skills: using a mouse and keyboard, navigating the internet, email, and online forms.​

    Job-search skills: resume creation, online applications, setting up email, and accessing government benefit portals.​

    Some classes may cover productivity software, online safety, and video interviews.​

Financial Stewardship & Vocational Training

Financial stewardship

    Classes on budgeting, banking, saving, and credit.​

    Support aligns with S.E.S. and F.E.S. program expectations to save monthly and manage program fees.​

    Topics may include opening accounts, avoiding predatory lending, and planning for rent and utilities.​

Vocational training and trade school connections

    URM connects guests with trade schools and vocational programs (e.g., construction, culinary, caregiving, commercial driving) through partner organizations.​

    Learning Center staff help with applications, placement tests, and financial aid forms when possible.​

    Past partners have included LA Mission College, Five Keys Schools and Programs, and other workforce organizations.​

Credit Recovery & Education Planning

Credit recovery

    For adults who were close to finishing high school, URM and partner schools can help identify missing credits and pathways to completion.​

    In some cases, guests can enroll with charter or adult high school programs that specialize in credit recovery.​

Education planning

    One-on-one support to map out education goals: GED, trade license, community college, or certification.​

    Assistance with applications, transcripts, and referrals to programs that fit your pace and recovery stage.​

How Guests Enroll

Step 1: Express interest

    Talk to your case manager, program staff, or the Learning Center directly.​

    If you are in Emmaus, Damascus Road, S.E.S., or F.E.S., education is often built into your case plan.​

Step 2: Assessment

    You may take placement tests (e.g., TABE) to determine reading and math levels.​

    Staff discuss your goals and available time (considering work therapy, appointments, and childcare).​

Step 3: Build a learning plan

    Together you and the educator design a schedule: classes, tutoring, computer lab time, and homework expectations.​

    Plans are flexible so they can be adjusted if your health or program schedule shifts.​

Step 4: Start classes

    You attend classes on-site in the Learning Center, often located within the URM building.​

    You may also be connected to online or external classes through partner schools.​

Typical Weekly Schedule

While exact schedules vary, a realistic weekly pattern for a program participant might include:​

    2–4 sessions per week of academic classes (ABE, GED/HiSET, or ESL).

    1–2 sessions per week of computer lab focused on job readiness.

    1 financial stewardship or life-skills workshop each week.

    1–2 hours of individual tutoring or homework support.

    Integration with work therapy, recovery groups, and appointments.

Guests in full-time recovery programs may spend more time in classes, while those working or in S.E.S./F.E.S. may attend fewer but targeted sessions.​
Certification Pathways & Realistic Outcomes

Possible certifications

    High school equivalency (GED/HiSET) certificate.​

    Specialized vocational certificates from partner programs (e.g., ServSafe for food handling, basic computer certificates, industry-specific trainings).​

    Documented course completion or training hours that can support job applications.​

Realistic timelines

    Basic literacy improvements: noticeable gains may occur over 2–6 months with steady attendance.​

    GED/HiSET: many guests need 6–12 months to prepare and pass all sections, depending on starting level and life disruptions.​

    Vocational certificates: some short programs last 4–12 weeks; longer or licensed programs can require many months of training.​

Realistic outcomes

    Improved confidence, ability to complete job applications, and readiness for interviews.​

    Better access to higher-paying jobs due to GED or training credentials.​

    Stronger financial habits and a clearer plan for housing and employment.​

What To Expect as a Student

    A supportive environment that understands relapse, mental health struggles, and life disruption are common; staff aim to encourage, not shame.​

    Flexible pacing; if you miss classes due to appointments or crises, you can often re-engage without starting from zero.​

    Use of adaptive learning software so you can work at your own level and speed.​

    Collaboration between education staff, case managers, and therapists to align your education goals with recovery and housing plans.​

How To Apply or Get Started

    If you are already at URM, ask for the Learning Center or talk to your case manager.​

    If you are not yet staying at URM, start by entering emergency services or a transitional/recovery program; education services are primarily for guests.​

    For questions, URM lists a Learning Center contact phone (e.g., Learning Center Director at 213-316-2752; confirm with URM’s current directory as numbers can change over time).​
