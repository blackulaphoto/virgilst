Women’s Damascus Road Recovery Program (Hope Gardens)

Damascus Road is a one-year, faith-based residential recovery program for single women, located at URM’s Hope Gardens Family Center in the mountains above Sylmar, away from the concentrated trauma of Skid Row.​
Program Overview

Damascus Road is designed for women seeking recovery from addiction, trauma, and life instability. The program has four phases over about 12 months:​

    Stabilization & Detox (Phase 1 – about 2 months).

    Trauma & Healing Work (Phase 2 – about 4 months).

    Life Skills & Job Readiness (Phase 3 – about 3 months).

    Employment & Permanent Housing (Phase 4 – about 3 months).​

Who This Is For

This program is for:

    Single adult women experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness who want long-term, structured recovery.​

    Women with substance use disorders or destructive behavioral patterns rooted in pain and trauma.​

    Women ready to live in a faith-based, residential community environment for approximately one year.​

Women with young children may be housed at Hope Gardens but Damascus Road, as described, is specifically a life-transformation program for single women; staff can explain family program options at Hope Gardens.​​
Location, Length, and Faith-Based Components

    Location: Hope Gardens Family Center, a URM campus in the hills near Sylmar, CA.​​

    Length: Approximately 12 months, divided into four phases (2 + 4 + 3 + 3 months).​

    Faith-based elements: Regular chapel services, prayer, Celebrate Recovery groups, and Christian discipleship are integrated throughout the program.​

Participation in spiritual activities is a core part of the program’s design, though women from different or no faith backgrounds can discuss expectations with staff before enrolling.​
Phase 1: Stabilization & Detox

Focus

    Initial stabilization from street life, crisis, and substance use.​

    First steps in recovery, including detoxification and establishing safety.​

    First approximately 14 days focused on detox, monitoring, and basic stabilization (in coordination with medical providers where needed).​

Core elements

    Trauma-informed groups and counseling to process past abuse, loss, and violence.​

    Classes and groups in anger management, parenting, domestic violence healing, addiction and relapse prevention, and boundaries.​

    Ongoing Celebrate Recovery participation and chapel services.​

Trauma-informed care

    Staff and clinicians understand trauma as central to many guests’ histories and design care that prioritizes safety, choice, collaboration, and empowerment.​

    Sessions are structured to avoid re-traumatization and to help women regain a sense of control and voice.​

Phase 3: Life Skills & Job Readiness

Focus

    Developing practical life skills, financial management, and job readiness while continuing recovery work.​

Key components

    Continuation of Phase 2 classes (healing, relapse prevention, boundaries) plus:​

        Financial management and budgeting.

        Resume building and job readiness skills.

        Work therapy assignments within URM or related settings.​

Work therapy model

    Work assignments help women practice responsibility, punctuality, teamwork, and communication in a supportive environment.​

    Tasks may include administrative support, kitchen or hospitality work, or other roles depending on ability and program needs.​

Phase 4: Employment & Permanent Housing

Focus

    Transitioning from recovery to stable employment and permanent housing.​

Core elements

    Continuation of classes from Phases 2 and 3 as needed.​

    Active job search: applications, interviews, and coordinated support with employment partners.​

    Housing search and transition planning, including applications for permanent supportive housing or independent rentals.​

    Setting and pursuing education goals (e.g., GED completion, college or trade school entry).​

Housing transition strategy

    Case managers work with each woman to develop a realistic housing plan based on her income, benefits, and support network.​

    Plans may include shared housing, supportive housing, or independent apartments; savings and budgeting are central to this phase.​

    Timelines vary; some women obtain employment and housing within the final three months, while others may need extended support or step-down programs.​

    Willingness to commit to a one-year, residential, faith-based program.​

    Ability to live in a communal environment and follow program rules.​

How to apply

    If you are currently at URM Downtown, speak with your case manager or chaplain and ask about “Damascus Road at Hope Gardens.”​

    If you are not at URM, call URM’s main line at (213) 347-6300 and ask for information about the women’s recovery program at Hope Gardens.​

    Staff will typically conduct a phone or in-person pre-screen, then schedule a more detailed intake if you appear eligible.​

Waiting list expectations

    During the wait, you may stay in URM emergency shelter or be referred to another safe location, where available.​

    Staying in contact with intake staff and keeping your phone/email updated is important so they can reach you when a bed opens.​

    Structured daily schedule including classes, groups, chapels, chores, and personal reflection time.​

    Curfews and rules about substance use, relationships, and conduct that support a safe environment.​
