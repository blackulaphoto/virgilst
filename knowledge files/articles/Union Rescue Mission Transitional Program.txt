Union Rescue Mission Transitional Programs (S.E.S. & F.E.S.)

URM’s transitional programs support people who are working or ready to pursue stability but still lack safe, affordable housing. S.E.S. serves single adults, while F.E.S. focuses on families with children.​
Overview: S.E.S. vs F.E.S.

    S.E.S. (Singles Emergency Services): One-year program for single men and women who need more than short-term emergency shelter but cannot commit to full recovery programs like Emmaus or Damascus Road.​

    F.E.S. (Family Emergency Services): Transitional program for families entering URM’s emergency shelter, offering at least 6 months of housing and support.​

Both programs combine shelter with case management, financial guidance, and access to URM’s support services.​
Who S.E.S. Is For

    Single adults who are homeless but may already be working, job searching, or otherwise stable enough for structured goals.​

    Individuals who need time (about a year) to build savings, address legal/credit issues, and secure housing but who are not entering intensive recovery.​

    People willing to pay a modest monthly program fee and commit to savings requirements.​

Program details

    Length: about 1 year.​

    Program fee: $150 per month.​

    Savings expectation: encouraged to save at least $60 per month.​

    Benefits:

        Emergency services (meals, shelter, wellness, legal services).

        Life-skills classes, including financial management.

        Job-readiness tutoring.

        Personal storage locker for belongings.

        Ongoing case management and permanent housing assistance.​

Who F.E.S. Is For

    Families with children entering URM’s emergency shelter who need a safer, more stable environment than street or motel living.​

    Parents who are working or seeking work and need structured support to move toward housing.​

Program details

    Length: minimum 6 months.​

    Program fee: families pay 15% of their monthly household income.​

    Savings requirement: families are asked to save at least 50% of their income.​

    Support:

        Same services as S.E.S. (meals, shelter, classes, case management, housing assistance).​

        Focus on the safety, health, and emotional well-being of children.​

Case managers help families create individual service plans and realistic budgets that meet these requirements.​

Emergency vs Transitional: What’s the Difference?

Emergency services

    Short-term, often night-to-night shelter with minimal requirements beyond basic rules.​​

    Focus on immediate safety, food, and basic care.​​

Transitional programs (S.E.S. & F.E.S.)

    Longer stays (6–12 months) with structured expectations and goals.​

    Program fees and mandatory or encouraged savings.​

    Required engagement with case management, life-skills classes, and housing planning.​

    Emphasis on moving toward permanent housing, not just providing nightly shelter.​

Permanent Housing Assistance and Realistic Exit Pathways

Permanent housing assistance

    Case managers help guests apply for housing vouchers, supportive housing, or affordable units where available.​

    Assistance assembling documents (ID, income verification, rental history) and navigating landlord requirements.​

    Collaboration with city and county housing programs as capacity permits.​

Realistic exit timelines

    For S.E.S.: Many guests may transition to shared housing or independent rentals after 9–12 months if income and savings are sufficient; some may need longer.​

    For F.E.S.: Families may move to permanent or supportive housing after 6–12 months or longer, depending on housing availability and income.​

Limitations

    URM cannot guarantee permanent housing for all participants; housing markets and program funding can affect outcomes.​

    Guests must actively participate and maintain program requirements to remain eligible.​

How To Apply for S.E.S. or F.E.S.

If you are already at URM

    Talk to your case manager about joining S.E.S. (if you are single) or F.E.S. (if you are a family).​

    You will review program fees, expectations, and your income situation.​

    Intake may include budgeting review, savings plan, and service plan development.​

If you are not yet at URM

    Call (213) 347-6300 and ask how to access emergency shelter for singles or families and express interest in transitional programs.​

    After entering emergency shelter, request a meeting with a case manager to see if you qualify for S.E.S. or F.E.S.​
