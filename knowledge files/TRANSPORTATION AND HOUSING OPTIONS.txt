TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING OPTIONS
Great, focusing on Los Angeles. I will begin an in-depth search for verified free transit ride
programs and housing voucher solutions, gathering specific application steps, eligibility criteria,
and contact info. I'll report back with concrete findings and instructions for accessing these
programs.
Here are concrete Los‑Angeles‑specific programs that can help your clients obtain free transit
rides and housing vouchers/assistance. I only included programs with verifiable sign‑up
information, eligibility requirements and phone numbers so you know exactly who to contact and
how to apply.

Metro LIFE
Program
(Low‑Income
Fare is Easy)
LA County residents age 18+
who are head‑of‑household
and can self‑certify that their
household income is below
the limits ($48,550 for one
person, $55,450 for two, etc.)
qualify for up to 20 free rides
every month or a discounted
monthly pass on Metro and
other participating transit
agencies. New participants
receive a free 90‑day pass;
unused rides roll over for up to
eight months. People who
already get fare discounts
through a school/university
U‑Pass, employer program or
Access Services are not
eligible.
1. Create a TAP card account at
taptogo.net and choose “LIFE” under
Programs. 2. Self‑certify your household
size and income and upload photo ID for
each household member. 3. Once
approved, log into your TAP account each
month and select “Add LIFE 20‑Ride” to
load your free rides (or visit a Metro
customer center or TAP vendor). If you
have trouble adding rides, call TAP
Customer Service at 866‑827‑8646. For
LIFE program questions, email
lifeinfo@metro.net or call the LIFE team
at 213‑922‑2378. Applications can also be
submitted by mail or in person at Metro
customer centers and Big Blue Bus transit
store drop‑offs.
LADOT
Cityride
For LA residents age 65+ or
qualified persons with
disabilities. Once approved,
participants receive a Cityride
card loaded with $84 of fare
value per quarter, which
costs $21 ($9 for low‑income
participants); the card can be
used for discounted taxi rides,
dial‑a‑ride trips and free
DASH bus rides.
Download the application from LADOT
Cityride and return it by mail with proof of
age or disability. Once approved, the
Cityride card and instructions on
reordering value are sent to the
participant. For help or to request a paper
application, call the Cityride hotline at
213/310/323/818‑808‑7433; TDD users
call 800‑559‑1950.
GoPass (LA
Metro)
K‑12 and community college
students attending
participating schools can ride
Metro buses and trains for
free, along with many
municipal bus systems. A
special GoPass TAP card
provides unlimited rides
throughout the school year.
Schools distribute unique GoPass
eligibility codes. Students (or a
parent/guardian) go to
taptogo.net/gopass, enter the code and
complete the registration form. The school
can answer questions or call Metro’s
Customer Relations (213‑922‑6235) for
assistance.
Access
Services
Free‑Fare
Program
People who qualify for ADA
paratransit (Access Services)
can ride most bus and rail
lines in Los Angeles County
for free by showing their
Access ID card. Eligibility is
based on a person’s ability to
use accessible buses and
trains rather than age or a
specific disability; applicants
undergo an in‑person transit
evaluation.
Request an application and evaluation
appointment by calling Access Customer
Service at 800‑827‑0829 (TDD
800‑827‑1359). After receiving an Access
ID card, simply show it when boarding
participating bus/rail services—no
additional registration is needed.
DPSS

Transportation
Assistance

Relief Opportunities for
Work (GROW)/START
program can receive bus
passes or gas vouchers to
attend orientation, training and
job search appointments.
Clients must first apply for General Relief
through DPSS (apply online or call
866‑613‑3777). After enrolling, a GROW
case manager will assess needs during
orientation and issue transportation
assistance (bus passes or gas vouchers)
as part of supportive services. Speak with
your GROW case manager for details.
2 – Housing vouchers and concrete housing solutions
Program/Resource Who qualifies & what it
provides
How to apply / whom to
contact
Section 8 Housing
Choice Voucher (HCV) –
Los Angeles County
Development Authority
(LACDA)
Helps very‑low‑income families,
older adults and people with
disabilities pay for rental
housing in the private market;
participants pay 30‑40 % of
their income and the voucher

new vouchers are only issued
through referrals from LA
County’s Coordinated Entry
System (CES) for homeless
individuals.
Encourage clients
experiencing homelessness to
call 2‑1‑1 or (800) 399‑6993 to
be connected to a CES service
provider. For general
questions about Section 8 or
to check waiting‑list status, call

about the waiting list can be
directed to ext. 11205. When
the waitlist reopens,

proof of income.
Housing Choice
Voucher – Housing
Authority of the City of
Los Angeles (HACLA)
HACLA administers Section 8
vouchers for the City of L.A.
The general waiting list is not
always open; previously it
opened for a short period in
2022. HACLA also administers
project‑based vouchers and
Emergency Housing Vouchers.
Monitor hacla.hcvlist.org for
wait‑list openings. For

Vouchers (EHVs)
HUD‑funded vouchers for
people who are homeless, at
risk of homelessness, fleeing
domestic violence or recently
homeless. EHVs cover rent
similarly to Section 8 but are

not directly from applicants.
To be screened for an EHV,
clients must be connected to a
homeless services provider.
Direct them to call 2‑1‑1 or

(800‑548‑6047). Service
providers determine eligibility
and refer clients to the housing
authority for an EHV.

receiving CalWORKs
These programs help homeless
or at‑risk families with children:

Tips for navigating these resources
● Dial 211 or 800‑548‑6047 for urgent shelter and housing – LAHSA’s call centers
screen families, adults and youth for emergency and longer‑term housing and can issue
referrals for vouchers or programs.
● Have documentation ready – Most programs require ID, Social Security cards, proof of
income, and (for homeless‑preference vouchers) proof of homelessness (e.g., eviction
notice, letter from shelter).
● Stay in contact – For voucher waitlists, applicants must update their contact
information; failure to respond to mailings can result in removal from the list.
● Case managers as advocates – Many programs (CalWORKs, Housing for Health,
HOPWA) require a referral from a service provider. As a case manager, you can initiate
those referrals and advocate for your clients when contacting agencies.
By leveraging these programs—LIFE, Cityride, GoPass, Access Services, Section 8,
CalWORKs assistance, HOPWA and LAHSA resources—you can help clients in Los Angeles
gain mobility and access stable housing
