The main online doorway to apply for most benefits is BenefitsCal at https://www.benefitscal.com. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Introduction: DPSS Is More Than Food Stamps\r\n\r\nMany people think DPSS only does “CalFresh” or food stamps, but California’s social services system covers almost every part of basic survival: food, rent, health care, and work support. These programs are run by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) and local county welfare departments (DPSS/SSA/HHS/HSA/DHA), and many can be applied for together in one application. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh)\r\n\r\nThe central benefits portal for most counties is **BenefitsCal** (https://benefitscal.com), which lets you apply for CalFresh, CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, and often General Relief online, upload proof documents, and check case status. You can also still apply by phone or in person if online access is difficult. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 1: CalFresh (Food Benefits)\r\n\r\nCalFresh helps low-income individuals and families buy food using an EBT card that works like a debit card at grocery stores, some farmers markets, and certain online retailers. It is available in every county and is open to many workers, families, seniors, students with exceptions, and some immigrants who meet federal and state rules. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh/gross-income.html)\r\n\r\n### Eligibility basics and income limits\r\n\r\nCalFresh is for people with low income who meet federal income rules and California’s CalFresh guidelines. For most households, monthly **gross income** (before deductions) must be at or below **200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)** to qualify under California’s modified categorical eligibility rules. If someone in the household is disqualified due to an intentional program violation, a stricter **130% FPL gross income** standard and resource rules apply. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/charts/assets/2CalFresh/CFMonthAllIncomeElig.htm)\r\n\r\nHouseholds with an elderly (60+) or disabled member have different income tests: the county may use **net income** limits instead of gross income limits, and some higher income thresholds apply. There is no property limit for most households applying only for CalFresh, though combined CalFresh + CalWORKs may involve resource rules. [venturacounty](https://venturacounty.gov/human-services-agency/main-homepage/how-to-apply-for-calfresh/)\r\n\r\nOfficial CalFresh program page: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh)\r\nLos Angeles CalFresh info: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n\r\n### Expedited/Emergency CalFresh\r\n\r\nIf you have very little money and food, you may qualify for **Expedited Service**, which provides CalFresh within 3 days and sometimes the same day after your application is received. LA County, for example, explains that expedited benefits are available if certain tests are met and requires an interview and ID verification, but photo ID is not required. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n\r\n### Restaurant Meals Program (RMP)\r\n\r\nCalifornia’s **Restaurant Meals Program** lets certain CalFresh recipients buy prepared hot food at participating restaurants using their EBT card. In counties that participate (including Los Angeles), it is usually limited to people who are homeless, elderly (60+), or disabled. You must already receive CalFresh and be coded as RMP-eligible by the county; ask your worker specifically about “Restaurant Meals Program eligibility.” [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n\r\n### How to apply for CalFresh\r\n\r\nYou can usually apply for CalFresh together with other programs (CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, General Relief) through BenefitsCal. In Los Angeles County, for example, you can apply: [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n\r\n- Online: https://www.benefitscal.com [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n- By phone: LA DPSS Customer Service Center (CalFresh Apply) at **(866) 613‑3777** (press option 2, then 2 again for CalFresh). [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n- In person: At a local DPSS district office listed on https://dpss.lacounty.gov under “Office Locations.” [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n\r\nBasic steps (similar in most counties):  \r\n\r\n1. **Create a BenefitsCal account** at https://benefitscal.com and start a new application for CalFresh. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n2. **Answer screening questions** about household size, income, rent, and expenses; you can also mark that you need expedited CalFresh if you are in crisis. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n3. **Upload or submit documents**: ID, proof of address, pay stubs, rent receipts, and utility bills help show your situation. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh/gross-income.html)\r\n4. **Complete an interview** by phone or in person, normally within 7 days for expedited cases and 30 days for regular cases. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html)\r\n5. **Get an EBT card** if approved, usually mailed or available for pickup at your county office. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh)\r\n\r\n### Recertification process\r\n\r\nCalFresh is not permanent; you must **recertify** periodically (often every 12 or 24 months, depending on the household) and complete periodic reports like SAR‑7 in some counties. You will receive a notice when it is time to recertify and must: [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n\r\n- Complete the recertification form (online via BenefitsCal, by mail, or in person). [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n- Submit updated income and household information. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/charts/assets/2CalFresh/CFMonthAllIncomeElig.htm)\r\n- Attend a recertification interview if required. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh/gross-income.html)\r\n\r\nMissing recertification steps is a common reason benefits stop, so open all mail from the county and read notices in your BenefitsCal account. [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n\r\n### Work requirements\r\n\r\nIn California, most non‑exempt CalFresh household members aged **16–59** must register for work as a condition of eligibility. Federal rules also impose **time‑limited benefits** for some adults without dependents; California uses a statewide 36‑month clock for these time limits, and there are exemptions and good cause rules. Many people are exempt due to disability, pregnancy, caring for a child, or other reasons, so always ask your worker if you can be exempt. [wclp](https://wclp.org/calfresh-work-reporting/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 2: CalWORKs (Cash Aid + Much More)\r\n\r\nCalWORKs is California’s main cash assistance and work-support program for families with children. It provides monthly cash, employment services, and many supportive services like housing help, transportation, and child care. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks.html)\r\n\r\nOfficial CalWORKs site: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\nLA County CalWORKs: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks.html)\r\n\r\n### Basic eligibility\r\n\r\nCalWORKs serves families with at least one child under 18 (or under 19 if graduating by their 19th birthday) living in the home, and the parent/caretaker must live in California and meet immigration and other eligibility rules. Families must have low income and limited resources; as an example, statewide rules set a resource limit around $12,552 (higher if the family includes an older adult or someone with a disability), with exemptions for things like a home and one car up to a certain value. Exact income and grant amounts depend on your county, household size, and situation. [ca.db101](https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm)\r\n\r\n### Monthly cash assistance\r\n\r\nCalWORKs gives monthly cash aid to help pay for basic needs like housing, utilities, and clothing. Payments are generally made through EBT or direct deposit, and amounts are based on a “Maximum Aid Payment” schedule that varies by county and family size. [ca.db101](https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm)\r\n\r\n### Welfare-to-Work (WTW) / GAIN\r\n\r\nMost non‑exempt adults on CalWORKs must participate in Welfare‑to‑Work (WTW) activities, called **GAIN** (Greater Avenues for Independence) in Los Angeles County. GAIN offers job club, vocational assessment, education and training, subsidized employment, community service, and post‑employment services. The program can also help with **transportation, child care, and special job‑related expenses such as uniforms and tools**, and can connect you to domestic violence, mental health, and substance use disorder services. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n\r\nLA GAIN information: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain.html)\r\n\r\n### Housing Support Program (HSP) and Homeless Assistance\r\n\r\nThe **CalWORKs Housing Support Program (HSP)** provides housing-focused case management and financial assistance to eligible CalWORKs families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. HSP can help with interim housing (including motels), rental assistance, security deposits, and housing navigation; details vary by county and are administered locally through county welfare departments. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n\r\nCalWORKs **Homeless Assistance (HA)** includes temporary and permanent assistance for eligible CalWORKs families who are homeless. Temporary HA can help pay for up to 16 days of shelter (and may be issued in a lump sum when homelessness is caused by a declared disaster), while permanent HA can help with move‑in costs like deposits when securing housing. Disaster‑related homelessness may allow HA to be issued more than once in a 12‑month period. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n\r\n### Transportation, work clothing, and other supports\r\n\r\nSupportive services in WTW/GAIN can include:  \r\n\r\n- **Transportation** (bus passes, gas cards, mileage reimbursement) to attend approved activities. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDlgv0amqI)\r\n- **Child care** so you can attend training, job search, or work. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n- **Special job‑related expenses** such as tools, uniforms, and licensing fees required for employment. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDlgv0amqI)\r\n\r\nThese supports are **not automatic**; you must tell your worker what you need for your approved activity or job and keep receipts when required. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n\r\n### Child care and moving assistance\r\n\r\nCalWORKs participants may qualify for subsidized child care through the CalWORKs child care program, which is administered by county welfare departments and child care agencies. Housing-related supports like moving costs, security deposits, and utility payments may be available under CalWORKs HSP or Homeless Assistance and, in some counties, under housing programs like HDAP or Bringing Families Home. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\n### Emergency payments and disaster-related help\r\n\r\nCalWORKs can provide **Immediate Need** payments and **nonrecurring special needs payments** when families face emergencies such as fires or other disasters that damage or destroy housing or belongings. Nonrecurring special needs funds (up to a set maximum per incident) can help with temporary shelter, repair or replacement of clothing and household items, and related expenses. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n\r\n### How to apply and what documents you need\r\n\r\nYou can apply for CalWORKs:\r\n\r\n- Online: https://www.benefitscal.com (select cash aid / CalWORKs). [ca.db101](https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm)\r\n- By contacting your county social services agency; use the CDSS county office list at https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices)\r\n- In LA County: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks.html or call (866) 613‑3777. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks.html)\r\n\r\nYou typically must:\r\n\r\n1. Submit an initial application with basic information. [ca.db101](https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm)\r\n2. Attend an eligibility interview (phone or in-person) where the worker asks more detailed questions. [ha.saccounty](https://ha.saccounty.gov/benefits/CalWORKs/Documents/CalWORKs%20Fact%20Sheet%20January%202025.pdf)\r\n3. Provide **verification** such as ID, Social Security numbers (if available), birth certificates, proof of residence, rent receipts or lease, utility bills, and proof of income and resources. [ha.saccounty](https://ha.saccounty.gov/benefits/CalWORKs/Documents/CalWORKs%20Fact%20Sheet%20January%202025.pdf)\r\n\r\nAsk the worker about **CalWORKs Housing Support Program, Homeless Assistance, and Welfare‑to‑Work supportive services** during your interview, so they screen you for all possible help. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 3: General Relief / General Assistance (GR/GA)\r\n\r\n**General Relief (GR)** or **General Assistance (GA)** is a county‑funded cash aid program for adults with little or no income who do **not** have minor children and are not eligible for other cash aid programs. Each county sets its own payment levels, eligibility rules, and work requirements, so you must check your county’s website or call directly. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/contact-numbers-and-information)\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles County, GR is described as cash assistance for indigent adults without dependent children who are ineligible for federal or state programs. Many counties require participation in a **work program**, like LA County’s **GROW (General Relief Opportunities for Work)**, unless you are exempt due to disability or other reasons. Some counties treat GR as a **loan** that must be repaid if you later receive SSI or certain other benefits. [circaworks](https://circaworks.com/ask-the-expert/gain-grow-programs-in-los-angeles-county/)\r\n\r\nTo find your county’s GR/GA program details, visit the CDSS county office page: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices and click your county to get the local DPSS/SSA/HHS/HSA website and contact numbers. You can usually apply for GR/GA through BenefitsCal or by applying directly through your county social services office. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 4: Medi-Cal & CalAIM Enhanced Services\r\n\r\n**Medi-Cal** is California’s Medicaid program, which provides free or low‑cost health coverage for low‑income adults, children, seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant individuals, and some others. Counties help process Medi-Cal applications, and many people apply through the same BenefitsCal portal used for CalFresh and CalWORKs. [ssa.ocgov](https://ssa.ocgov.com/Changes-Medi-cal-Calfresh)\r\n\r\n### Medi-Cal basics and 2026 changes\r\n\r\nMedi-Cal eligibility is based on income, household size, and other factors, with many people qualifying under the Affordable Care Act “expansion” income rules. Starting **January 1, 2026**, asset/resource limits were reinstated for certain Medi-Cal groups such as adults 65+, people with disabilities, and some families whose income exceeds certain tax-based limits; countable assets can include bank accounts, cash, and some properties. [ssa.ocgov](https://ssa.ocgov.com/Changes-Medi-cal-Calfresh)\r\n\r\nProgram updates and renewal guidance: “Keep Your Benefits & Stay Healthy” at Los Angeles County: https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/ [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n\r\n### CalAIM: Enhanced Care Management and Community Supports\r\n\r\nCalifornia’s **CalAIM** initiative is transforming Medi-Cal to better serve people with complex needs through **Enhanced Care Management (ECM)** and **Community Supports** (also called In Lieu of Services). [dhcs.ca](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/ECMandILOS.aspx)\r\n\r\nOfficial CalAIM ECM & Community Supports page: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/ECMandILOS.aspx [dhcs.ca](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/ECMandILOS.aspx)\r\nCommunity Supports list: https://calaim.dhcs.ca.gov/pages/community-supports [calaim.dhcs.ca](https://calaim.dhcs.ca.gov/pages/community-supports)\r\n\r\n**Enhanced Care Management (ECM)** provides intensive care coordination for certain Medi-Cal members, such as people experiencing homelessness, high utilizers of emergency rooms, people with severe mental illness or substance use disorders, and others with complex needs. ECM helps with outreach and engagement, care planning, coordinating health and social services, and supporting transitions between settings. [nashp](https://nashp.org/calaim-leveraging-medicaid-managed-care-for-housing-and-homelessness-supports/)\r\n\r\n**Community Supports** can include housing‑related services and other supports, depending on your Medi-Cal managed care plan and county. Examples available through many plans include: [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/california-provider/patient-care/calaim)\r\n\r\n- Housing transition navigation services. [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/california-provider/patient-care/calaim)\r\n- Housing deposits and transitional rent. [calaim.dhcs.ca](https://calaim.dhcs.ca.gov/pages/community-supports)\r\n- Housing tenancy and sustaining services. [caloptima](https://www.caloptima.org/en/community-impact/calaim)\r\n- Short‑term post‑hospitalization housing and recuperative care (medical respite). [providerlibrary.healthnetcalifornia](https://providerlibrary.healthnetcalifornia.com/medi-cal/provider-manual/calaim/community-supports.html)\r\n- Respite services and other community‑based supports. [providerlibrary.healthnetcalifornia](https://providerlibrary.healthnetcalifornia.com/medi-cal/provider-manual/calaim/community-supports.html)\r\n\r\nTo access ECM or Community Supports, you must be enrolled in a Medi-Cal managed care plan that offers them and meet the population-of-focus criteria; your plan, county, or provider can refer you. [nashp](https://nashp.org/calaim-leveraging-medicaid-managed-care-for-housing-and-homelessness-supports/)\r\n\r\n### Transportation to medical appointments\r\n\r\nMedi-Cal managed care plans must provide **non-emergency medical transportation or non-medical transportation** for eligible members to get to covered medical appointments. You can call the number on your Medi-Cal plan card and ask for “transportation benefits” or ask your DPSS worker for help connecting with the plan’s transportation line. [dhcs.ca](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/ECMandILOS.aspx)\r\n\r\n### How to enroll in Medi-Cal\r\n\r\nYou can enroll in Medi-Cal:\r\n\r\n- Online: Through **BenefitsCal** (https://benefitscal.com) in most counties, or through **Covered California** at https://www.coveredca.com for people who may qualify for both Medi-Cal and Covered California. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n- By phone or in person: Call your county social services agency; numbers are listed at https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices and on county Medi-Cal pages. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/contact-numbers-and-information)\r\n\r\nGeneral steps:\r\n\r\n1. Submit an application (online, by mail, phone, or in person), selecting Medi-Cal. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n2. Provide verification such as ID, proof of California residency, income information, and immigration status if applicable. [ssa.ocgov](https://ssa.ocgov.com/Changes-Medi-cal-Calfresh)\r\n3. Once approved, select or are assigned a Medi-Cal managed care plan that will coordinate your care and CalAIM services if you qualify. [calaim.dhcs.ca](https://calaim.dhcs.ca.gov/pages/community-supports)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 5: Housing & Homelessness Programs Through DPSS\r\n\r\nCalifornia and county DPSS agencies operate several housing programs, often coordinated with Continuums of Care and local housing partners. Many of these are **CalWORKs‑linked** or targeted to specific populations. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\nKey CDSS housing programs page: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n### CalWORKs Housing Support Program (HSP)\r\n\r\nThe **CalWORKs Housing Support Program** helps CalWORKs families who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness find and keep permanent housing. HSP provides housing identification, landlord engagement, case management, rental assistance, security deposits, and often motel stays as a bridge to permanent housing; services and amounts vary by county. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n### Homeless Assistance (CalWORKs HA)\r\n\r\nAs described earlier, **Homeless Assistance** offers temporary shelter payments (up to a set number of days) and permanent assistance for move‑in costs for eligible CalWORKs families. When homelessness is due to a declared disaster, HA can be issued in a lump sum and the usual once‑every‑12‑months limit may not apply. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n\r\n### Housing and Disability Advocacy Program (HDAP)\r\n\r\nThe **Housing and Disability Advocacy Program (HDAP)** helps people who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness and are likely eligible for disability benefits (like SSI/SSDI). HDAP provides outreach, case management, disability benefits advocacy, and **housing assistance**, including interim shelter, rental assistance, housing navigation, security deposits, utility payments, moving costs, legal services, and credit repair. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\nHDAP overview: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\n### Bringing Families Home (BFH) and other housing programs\r\n\r\nCDSS’s **Bringing Families Home** program focuses on helping families in the child welfare system who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness obtain and maintain housing so that children can remain safely with their families or return home. Other housing initiatives under CDSS include programs for foster youth, people exiting institutions, and other vulnerable populations, and they are administered through county agencies and local partners. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n### Referrals to Coordinated Entry and local shelters\r\n\r\nCounties often use a **Coordinated Entry System (CES)** for homelessness services, where individuals and families are assessed and matched with housing resources based on vulnerability and need. DPSS staff may refer you to CES, local shelter access lines, or housing navigators when you identify as homeless or at risk of homelessness during your application or interview. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\nAsk your worker directly for:\r\n\r\n- “Housing screening” for CalWORKs HSP and Homeless Assistance.  \r\n- A referral to **HDAP** if you are homeless and have a disabling condition or are seeking disability benefits. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n- A **Coordinated Entry** referral or local shelter hotline for your area. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 6: Identification & Document Replacement Support\r\n\r\nWhether DPSS directly pays for replacement IDs and vital records can vary by county and by program, but some housing and CalWORKs‑linked programs can help with these costs as **supportive services**.  \r\n\r\nUnder **HDAP**, for example, housing-related financial assistance can include costs needed to secure housing and benefits, and counties may use these funds for fees related to applications for disability benefits and associated documentation. Some CalWORKs programs and local housing initiatives may also cover costs like birth certificates or state IDs when needed to obtain or maintain housing or employment, but policies are local and not uniform. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\nTransportation assistance (like bus passes or gas cards) can be provided as a WTW/GAIN supportive service to attend required appointments, including those related to obtaining documents or going to welfare offices. Verification typically involves showing that the expense is related to an approved activity or needed to access benefits, and counties may request receipts or a written explanation. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDlgv0amqI)\r\n\r\nFor exact rules in your county, contact your county social services office through https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices and ask whether CalWORKs, HSP, HDAP, or other programs can help pay for replacement birth certificates, California IDs, or Social Security card fees. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 7: Employment & Training Benefits\r\n\r\nDPSS and related programs provide job training and employment support so that families can become more self‑sufficient. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n\r\n### GAIN (Welfare-to-Work for CalWORKs)\r\n\r\nThe **GAIN** program in Los Angeles County, and equivalent Welfare‑to‑Work programs in other counties, offer employment services for CalWORKs participants. Services include: [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain.html)\r\n\r\n- Job Club and job preparation workshops.  \r\n- Vocational assessment to identify skills and barriers.  \r\n- Education and training, including basic education and skills training. [selacowdb](http://www.selacowdb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GAIN-Program-Overview-11-2017.pdf)\r\n- Subsidized employment and community service placements. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n- Post‑employment services to help you keep and advance in your job. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDlgv0amqI)\r\n\r\nGAIN also provides **supportive services** like transportation, child care, and payment for special job‑related expenses such as tools and uniforms. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n\r\nLA GAIN: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain.html)\r\n\r\n### Job search support and training/tuition\r\n\r\nThrough WTW/GAIN, counties can help with job search (resumés, applications, interview skills), supervised job search periods, and referral to training or education programs that can count toward your participation requirements. Some counties partner with community colleges, adult schools, or training providers, and may help with tuition, books, or fees when these are part of an approved activity, though specifics vary. [pathwaystowork.acf](https://pathwaystowork.acf.gov/intervention-detail/591)\r\n\r\nBecause details on specialized certifications (such as RADT – Registered Alcohol/Drug Technician) and tuition support are county‑specific, ask your GAIN or WTW worker:  \r\n\r\n- Whether your desired training or certification can be added to your WTW plan.  \r\n- What costs (tuition, fees, books, licensing exams) the county can cover as supportive services. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n\r\n### Tools, uniforms, licensing fees\r\n\r\nSupportive services can pay for certain mandatory work items such as uniforms, tools, safety equipment, and required licensing or certification fees when they are necessary for a job or for an approved WTW activity. This generally requires your worker’s approval and documentation (like a job offer or training requirements). [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDlgv0amqI)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 8: Special Programs People Don’t Know About\r\n\r\nSeveral important protections and special benefits are built into California’s social services system.  \r\n\r\n### Domestic violence waivers and exemptions\r\n\r\nCalWORKs/Welfare‑to‑Work has **domestic abuse waivers** and **exemptions** that can temporarily waive program requirements when complying would make it harder or more dangerous for a survivor of domestic violence to participate or work. Counties can waive or modify requirements like work participation, time limits, or child support cooperation when domestic abuse prevents participation; these waivers are granted on a case‑by‑case basis and must be reviewed periodically. Sworn statements by survivors can be sufficient to verify abuse, and documentation is not always required. [socialservices.alamedacountyca](https://socialservices.alamedacountyca.gov/acssa-assets/PDF/CalWORKs-Policies/CalWORKs%20Handbook%2042-7.7%20Domestic%20Violence%20Abuse%20Policies%20and%20Procedures%20for%20Waivers%20and%20Exemptions%20.pdf)\r\n\r\nAsk your CalWORKs worker or social worker specifically about **“CalWORKs domestic abuse waivers”** or **“Welfare‑to‑Work exemptions due to domestic violence.”** [ssa.ocgov](https://www.ssa.ocgov.com/sites/ssa/files/import/data/files/32252.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Exemptions from work requirements\r\n\r\nBeyond domestic violence, CalWORKs and CalFresh provide **good cause** and **exemption** rules for people who cannot participate in work activities due to disability, illness, caregiving responsibilities, or other serious barriers. If you are sanctioned or at risk of sanction, ask for an exemption review and explain your situation in detail. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2024/02/calworks-domestic-abuse-policies/)\r\n\r\n### Transportation and child care reimbursements\r\n\r\nAs noted, WTW/GAIN can pay for transportation to approved activities and may reimburse mileage, gas, or other travel costs when required to participate. CalWORKs child care programs can pay child care providers so you can attend work or required activities, and in some cases reimburse you for child care costs if you meet program rules; specific policies differ by county and stage of child care. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n\r\n### Utility assistance referrals\r\n\r\nWhile DPSS may not directly pay regular utility bills, counties often refer clients to programs such as LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) or local utility assistance, and CalWORKs/Housing programs may help with **utility arrears or deposits** when needed to secure or keep housing. Ask for utility assistance or referrals during housing screening. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\n### Disaster relief and one-time emergency payments\r\n\r\nCDSS operates disaster-related programs such as **Disaster CalFresh** and coordinates with FEMA and other agencies when there is a major emergency. CalWORKs families may qualify for nonrecurring special needs payments for emergencies (like fires) and **Immediate Need** payments when they have no money for food, shelter, or essential needs. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/disaster-help-center)\r\n\r\nCDSS disaster help center: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/disaster-help-center [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/disaster-help-center)\r\nDisaster Grant Assistance info: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/disaster-services-branch/disaster-grant-assistance [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/disaster-services-branch/disaster-grant-assistance)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 9: Step-by-Step – How to Access Everything\r\n\r\nThis roadmap is what many good case managers walk people through.  \r\n\r\n1. **Create a BenefitsCal account**  \r\n   - Go to https://www.benefitscal.com and create an account with your email or phone. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n   - Set up security questions and remember your login; this is where you’ll see messages and upload documents. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n\r\n2. **Submit one application for all programs you might qualify for**  \r\n   - Start a new application and select **CalFresh, CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, and General Relief/Assistance** if you might qualify. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n   - Answer questions honestly about everyone in your household, income, rent, utilities, and any disabilities or homelessness. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh/gross-income.html)\r\n\r\n3. **Schedule and complete your interview**  \r\n   - Watch for calls, texts, mail, or messages on BenefitsCal, and answer calls from numbers you don’t recognize during business hours. [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n   - If you miss a call, call your county back using the number on your notice (for LA, (866) 613‑3777) and ask to reschedule or complete the interview. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/contact-numbers-and-information)\r\n\r\n4. **Request a housing screening**  \r\n   - During your interview, clearly say if you are **homeless, couch‑surfing, staying in a car or motel, or at risk of losing housing.** [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n   - Ask for a **housing screening** and to be evaluated for **CalWORKs Homeless Assistance, CalWORKs Housing Support Program, and HDAP** if you have a disabling condition. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n5. **Ask specifically about CalWORKs HSP and Homeless Assistance**  \r\n   - If you are a family with children and applying for or already receiving CalWORKs, insist on being screened for **HSP** and **Homeless Assistance**. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n   - Ask what documents you need (like a Notice to Pay or Quit, homelessness verification, or motel receipts) and how quickly they can issue assistance. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n\r\n6. **Ask about transportation, child care, and work support**  \r\n   - If you are in a WTW/GAIN activity or working, ask your worker to authorize **transportation and child care** and to cover any required tools, uniforms, or licensing fees. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n   - Keep receipts and follow the county’s instructions for reimbursements or direct payments to providers. [sgvc](https://sgvc.org/places/dpss-calworks-gain-programs/)\r\n\r\n7. **Keep your documentation updated**  \r\n   - Use your BenefitsCal account to upload new pay stubs, rent changes, or household changes as soon as they happen. [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n   - Respond quickly to requests for verification and keep copies of what you turn in. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh/gross-income.html)\r\n\r\n8. **Follow up every 30 days if you’re waiting**  \r\n   - If you are waiting on a decision or housing support, check your BenefitsCal messages and call your county at least once a month to ask about status. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/contact-numbers-and-information)\r\n   - If you get a confusing notice, call your worker or the main customer service line right away rather than ignoring it. [ad.lacounty](https://ad.lacounty.gov/about-us/campaigns/hr1-keep-your-benefits-stay-healthy/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 10: County Contact Directory (Key Counties)\r\n\r\nYou can find all county offices at: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices Below are major counties many readers use. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices)\r\n\r\n| County | Agency & Website | Main Phone (Benefits/DPSS) |\r\n|-------|-------------------|----------------------------|\r\n| **Los Angeles** | Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services – https://dpss.lacounty.gov | Customer Service Center: **(866) 613‑3777** [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food/calfresh.html) |\r\n| **San Diego** | County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency – Self‑Sufficiency Services at https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/hhsa | Access Customer Service (general benefits line, listed via CDSS county offices) – see San Diego listing at https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices) |\r\n| **Orange** | Orange County Social Services Agency – https://ssa.ocgov.com | General information lines and Medi‑Cal/CalFresh/CalWORKs numbers listed at https://ssa.ocgov.com/about/contact-us and via CDSS contact list [ssa.ocgov](https://ssa.ocgov.com/Changes-Medi-cal-Calfresh) |\r\n| **Riverside** | Riverside County Department of Public Social Services – https://dpss.co.riverside.ca.us | Main: **(951) 358‑3000** (listed on CDSS CalFresh contact numbers) [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/contact-numbers-and-information) |\r\n| **San Bernardino** | San Bernardino County Human Services – Transitional Assistance Department at https://hs.sbcounty.gov | Contact numbers available through county website and CDSS county offices listing [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices) |\r\n| **Sacramento** | Sacramento County Department of Human Assistance – https://ha.saccounty.gov | DHA office locations and numbers (including CalWORKs office numbers) listed at https://ha.saccounty.gov and CDSS contact list [ha.saccounty](https://ha.saccounty.gov/benefits/CalWORKs/Documents/CalWORKs%20Fact%20Sheet%20January%202025.pdf) |\r\n\r\nFor the full and most current directory (including fax numbers and additional offices), always check the official CDSS county office list: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/county-offices)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 11: Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n- **Only applying for CalFresh.** Many people qualify for CalWORKs cash aid, Medi-Cal, and housing programs but only apply for food; use BenefitsCal to apply for all programs you might qualify for. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n- **Not asking about housing programs.** HSP, Homeless Assistance, HDAP, and other housing supports are often only offered when you mention homelessness or housing risk, so always speak up. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2025/03/calworks-case-processing-during-disasters/)\r\n- **Missing interviews.** If you miss a scheduled interview, your application can be denied or delayed—call back quickly to reschedule. [ca.db101](https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm)\r\n- **Ignoring mail or notices.** Important deadlines and recertification notices can come by mail or in your BenefitsCal messages; ignoring them can stop your benefits. [stgenssa.sccgov](https://stgenssa.sccgov.org/debs/program_handbooks/charts/assets/2CalFresh/CFMonthAllIncomeElig.htm)\r\n- **Not updating address or phone.** If your contact info is wrong, you may miss recertification and appointment notices; always update your address and phone in BenefitsCal and with your worker. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommunityHealthInitiativeofOrangeCounty/videos/benefitscal/2098085230604634/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 12: Timeline Expectations\r\n\r\nTimelines can vary by county and by program, but general standards and examples include:  \r\n\r\n- **CalFresh application and interviews:** Most CalFresh applications must be processed within **30 days**, with interviews and eligibility decisions made in that period. Expedited cases meeting special criteria can receive benefits within **3 days**. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh)\r\n- **CalWORKs cash aid:** CalWORKs applications also typically follow a 30‑day processing timeframe, though **Immediate Need** payments may be available faster if you have an emergency and appear eligible. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n- **Medi-Cal:** Many Medi-Cal applications are decided within 45 days (or within 90 days for disability-based cases), though timelines may vary somewhat by county and case type. [ssa.ocgov](https://ssa.ocgov.com/Changes-Medi-cal-Calfresh)\r\n- **Housing assistance:** CalWORKs Homeless Assistance can be issued quickly once eligibility is verified, including same‑day or lump‑sum payments in disaster situations, but hotel availability and administrative steps may affect timing. HSP and HDAP housing placements can take longer because they depend on finding available units and working with landlords, but they often start with interim shelter or rental assistance while you search. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\nIf your emergency is urgent (no food, nowhere to sleep, utilities shut‑off), tell your worker clearly that you have an **emergency** and ask about expedited or immediate help such as Expedited CalFresh, Immediate Needs, Homeless Assistance, or local referrals. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/disaster-help-center)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis guide is only a starting point; every county has its own extra programs, pilot projects, and local partnerships that can add even more support. Using BenefitsCal, staying in close contact with your worker, and asking directly about housing, transportation, work support, and domestic violence waivers can unlock help far beyond food stamps.

The reality is that there is no single application that takes you straight from a shelter bed into a Section 8 voucher; most people move through several layers of programs, waitlists, and referrals before they reach truly **stable** housing. This guide walks you through a realistic, step‑by‑step pathway you can follow in California, with phone numbers, websites, and tips to help you stay organized and persistent. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Introduction: Why Housing Help Feels So Confusing in California\r\n\r\nCalifornia uses a layered system: local homeless systems (Coordinated Entry), county benefits (like CalWORKs, General Relief, HDAP), federal housing vouchers and affordable housing properties, plus special pathways for veterans, survivors of violence, and disabled people. These systems are managed by different agencies (HUD, California Department of Social Services (CDSS), local Continuums of Care (CoCs), county DPSS offices, and nonprofits), so you often need multiple applications and referrals at the same time. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\nHousing help rarely works “first come, first served.” Instead, California communities use “vulnerability” or “prioritization” scores in Coordinated Entry to decide who is offered limited housing resources first. At the same time, county programs like CalWORKs Housing Support Program, Homeless Assistance, and HDAP can help with motel stays, move‑in costs, and short‑term rent support while you wait for longer‑term options. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\nThere is also no single statewide waitlist for Section 8 or affordable housing; every housing authority and every building usually has its own application and waitlist, which means casting a wide net is essential. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 1: Step One – Emergency Shelter & Coordinated Entry\r\n\r\n### Call 211 to Start\r\n\r\nIn most of California, your first step is to contact 211, which connects you to local shelters, outreach teams, and Coordinated Entry. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\n- Statewide 211 website: https://211ca.org [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n- You can dial **211** from most phones to reach your local 211.  \r\n\r\nLocal 211 examples (these route based on your location):  \r\n\r\n- Los Angeles County: dialing 211 or visiting https://www.211la.org connects you to LA County’s homeless services and Coordinated Entry access points. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n- Bay Area (example): 211 services (such as 211 Bay Area) route people to local CoC‑funded programs and shelters in counties like San Francisco, Alameda, and Santa Clara. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n- San Diego County: 211 San Diego connects to the Regional Task Force on Homelessness Coordinated Entry System. [rtfhsd](https://www.rtfhsd.org/about-coc/coordinated-entry-system-ces/)\r\n\r\n211 can:  \r\n\r\n- Tell you where to go for shelter or an in‑person assessment.  \r\n- Schedule or direct you to a Coordinated Entry assessment.  \r\n- Connect you to county benefits offices and legal help.  \r\n\r\n[Citations] [rtfhsd](https://www.rtfhsd.org/about-coc/coordinated-entry-system-ces/)\r\n\r\n### Coordinated Entry and Continuums of Care (CoCs)\r\n\r\nHUD requires each Continuum of Care (CoC) – the regional homeless system – to run a Coordinated Entry System (CES) that standardizes how people access housing and services. A CoC is usually county‑wide or multi‑county and includes shelters, outreach teams, rapid rehousing, and permanent supportive housing programs funded by HUD’s homelessness programs. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)\r\n\r\nKey points about Coordinated Entry in California:  \r\n\r\n- It is meant to be a single front door so you don’t have to apply separately to every homeless program. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)\r\n- Access points can be shelters, drop‑in centers, outreach teams, or special sites for youth or domestic violence survivors. [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/docs/gpp/california-provider/CA_CAID_HomelessCoordinatedEntrySystems.pdf?v=202411131531)\r\n- HUD requires CoC and ESG‑funded programs to participate in CES and to use a standardized assessment and prioritization process. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)\r\n\r\nCalifornia’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) also encourages counties to use Housing First and Coordinated Entry for state‑funded programs, including Homekey projects and state homelessness grants. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)\r\n\r\n### How Assessments Work and Why Vulnerability Scores Matter\r\n\r\nWhen you connect with CES, staff or outreach workers will:  \r\n\r\n- Collect basic information (name, DOB, contact info, where you are sleeping).  \r\n- Ask about your housing history, disabilities, health, safety, and other needs.  \r\n- Use a standardized tool (often a modified VI‑SPDAT or similar) to assign a vulnerability score that helps prioritize who gets limited resources. [csocstan](https://csocstan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CES-Policy.pdf)\r\n\r\nInformation is usually entered into an HMIS (Homeless Management Information System) so that different providers in the CoC can see your profile and match you to openings. Higher vulnerability scores (for example, chronic homelessness, serious health issues, high risk of harm) are prioritized for scarce slots like permanent supportive housing and some rapid rehousing programs. [housingfirstsolano](https://www.housingfirstsolano.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Policies-and-Procedures.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis does **not** mean you did anything wrong if you are not placed quickly; it usually means there are more people in need than there are units or subsidies available. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [housingfirstsolano](https://www.housingfirstsolano.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Policies-and-Procedures.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 2: Step Two – County Support Programs (DPSS / CalWORKs / General Relief)\r\n\r\nAfter you connect with Coordinated Entry, your next move is usually to apply for county benefits and housing programs. In most counties, this is through the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) or Social Services Agency.  \r\n\r\n### Key California State Housing Programs (CDSS)\r\n\r\nCDSS runs several housing and homelessness programs that counties operate locally. Main housing programs page: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs)\r\n\r\nPrograms to know:  \r\n\r\n1. **CalWORKs Housing Support Program (HSP)**  \r\n   - Helps CalWORKs families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to obtain and keep permanent housing. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-housing-support-program)\r\n   - Can provide: temporary shelter (including **hotel/motel vouchers**), rental assistance, security deposits, utility payments, moving costs, and intensive case management/housing navigation. [heartofsmc](https://www.heartofsmc.org/resource/the-calworks-housing-support-program/)\r\n   - You must be a CalWORKs family (with a child or pregnant and meeting income rules). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n   - Access: Apply for CalWORKs at your county welfare office (DPSS) and ask specifically for HSP. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks)\r\n\r\n2. **CalWORKs Homeless Assistance (HA)**  \r\n   - Offers **Temporary Homeless Assistance**: payments for emergency shelter (often motels) for up to 16 days, generally once every 12 months (with some exceptions).

[cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-housing-support-program)\r\n- **Ongoing rent subsidies**  \r\n  - HSP often uses a rapid‑rehousing‑style model: short to medium‑term rental subsidies plus case management. [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)\r\n  - HDAP can provide rental assistance while disability benefits applications are pending. [reg.summaries](https://reg.summaries.guide/2026/01/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program-funding-for-fiscal-year-2025-26/)\r\n  - Long‑term subsidies usually come from Section 8/Housing Choice Vouchers or permanent supportive housing, not from CalWORKs alone.

It can look like: [longbeach](https://www.longbeach.gov/globalassets/homelessness/media-library/documents/document-library/coc-ces-policies-and-procedures--final-062023-)\r\n\r\n- Motel or hotel converted into temporary or interim housing.  \r\n- Dorm‑style or small private units with on‑site support services.  \r\n- Time‑limited stays with the goal of moving to permanent housing (voucher unit, tax credit apartment, permanent supportive housing).  \r\n\r\nMany Homekey‑funded projects in California started as interim or bridge housing by converting hotels and motels. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)\r\n\r\n- Homekey info: https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-funding/programs-active/homekey [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/Housing-First-Guidance-Checklist.pdf)\r\n\r\n### What Rapid Rehousing Is\r\n\r\nRapid rehousing is a housing intervention that provides short‑ to medium‑term rental assistance and services to help people quickly move into and stabilize in housing. It usually includes: [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)\r\n\r\n- Help finding a unit and negotiating with landlords.  \r\n- Time‑limited rental assistance (for example 3–24 months, depending on program and budget).  \r\n- Case management focused on increasing income and keeping the housing.  \r\n\r\nCalifornia uses rapid rehousing in CalWORKs HSP, local CoC programs, and some state homelessness initiatives. [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [hcd.ca](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/calich/performance_measure_guide.pdf)\r\n\r\n### How You Get Referred (Usually Not Direct Application)\r\n\r\nMost rapid rehousing and bridge‑housing programs in California **do not** accept walk‑in or direct applications. Instead:  \r\n\r\n- They pull clients from the CoC’s Coordinated Entry System “community queue” based on vulnerability and program fit. [sbchp.sbcounty](https://sbchp.sbcounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2024/09/San-Bernardino-County-CES-Training-Manual-7-2024.pdf)\r\n- Some county programs (for example HSP, HDAP) may directly enroll people who qualify for their benefits, then coordinate with CES for permanent housing referrals. [providers.anthem](https://providers.anthem.com/docs/gpp/california-provider/CA_CAID_HomelessCoordinatedEntrySystems.pdf?v=202411131531)\r\n\r\nThis is why Step One (Coordinated Entry) and Step Two (County DPSS/CDSS programs) are so important; they position you for these referrals when slots open.  \r\n\r\n[Citations] [sbchp.sbcounty](https://sbchp.sbcounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2024/09/San-Bernardino-County-CES-Training-Manual-7-2024.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Documents Typically Required\r\n\r\nFor rapid rehousing or bridge housing, programs commonly ask for:  \r\n\r\n- ID and Social Security number (or proof of having applied).  \r\n- Proof of homelessness (shelter letter, outreach verification, eviction notice, motel receipts).  \r\n- Income information (pay stubs, benefit letters, or statement that you have no income).  \r\n- For some programs, disability or veteran status documentation where relevant.  \r\n\r\nThese requirements come from HUD and state definitions of homelessness and program eligibility. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 4: Step Four – Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)\r\n\r\n### What Section 8 Is\r\n\r\nThe Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program – commonly called “Section 8” – is a federal program that helps low‑income households afford housing in the private market by paying a portion of the rent directly to the landlord. Participants usually pay around 30% of their adjusted income toward rent, and the voucher covers the rest up to a payment standard set by the local Public Housing Agency (PHA). [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n- HUD HCV tenant info: https://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\n### Waitlists and How to Find PHAs\r\n\r\nEach PHA runs its own Section 8 waitlist, and many in California keep their lists closed for long periods because demand is so high. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\n- HUD PHA contact tool (nationwide, including California PHAs):  \r\n  https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\nMajor California PHAs include, for example:  \r\n\r\n- Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA): https://www.hacla.org [hacla](https://www.hacla.org/en/about-section-8/homeless-initiatives)\r\n- San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA – functions now integrated into city housing agencies but still uses HUD programs). [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n- Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency (SHRA): https://www.shra.org [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n- San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC): https://www.sdhc.org [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)\r\n\r\nEach PHA website will tell you:  \r\n\r\n- If the HCV/Section 8 waitlist is open or closed.  \r\n- How to apply when open (often online).  \r\n- Whether they have special waitlists (for example, project‑based vouchers, homeless set‑aside, veterans).  \r\n\r\n[Citations] [hacla](https://www.hacla.org/en/about-section-8/homeless-initiatives)\r\n\r\n### Income Limits and Eligibility\r\n\r\nSection 8 is targeted to low‑income households, generally those with income at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI), with some vouchers targeted to those at or below 30% of AMI. PHAs use HUD’s income limits for their area and may give preference to certain groups (for example, local residents, homeless households, veterans), as allowed by HUD rules. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n### Timeline Realities (1–10+ Years)\r\n\r\nBecause rents in California are high and federal voucher funding is limited, Section 8 waitlists in large metro areas can be extremely long. It is common for people to wait several years between applying and receiving a voucher when lists are open at all. In some high‑cost areas, advocates and PHAs report wait times of 5–10+ years between application and selection, especially when the PHA uses a lottery system. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\nThere is no guaranteed timeline, and many people never reach the top if they move, miss notices, or the PHA closes the list before reaching them. This is why you should never rely on Section 8 alone as your only plan.  \r\n\r\n[Citations] [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n### Source‑of‑Income Protections in California\r\n\r\nCalifornia law protects tenants from discrimination based on “source of income,” which includes housing vouchers such as Section 8. [calcivilrights.ca](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/housing/)\r\n\r\n- California Civil Rights Department (Housing Discrimination page): https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/housing [calcivilrights.ca](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/housing/)\r\n- California DOJ tenant info: https://oag.ca.gov/tenants [oag.ca](https://oag.ca.gov/tenants)\r\n\r\nLandlords generally cannot refuse to rent to you just because you have a Section 8 voucher or other rental assistance; that can be illegal discrimination. If you believe you are being denied housing because of your voucher or another protected characteristic, you can file a complaint with the Civil Rights Department. [oag.ca](https://oag.ca.gov/tenants)\r\n\r\n[Citations] [oag.ca](https://oag.ca.gov/tenants)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 5: Step Five – Low‑Income & Affordable Housing Units\r\n\r\nEven if you are waiting on Section 8 or don’t qualify, you can apply directly to affordable housing buildings.  \r\n\r\n### HUD Resource Locator\r\n\r\nThe HUD Resource Locator helps you find subsidized properties, public housing, and HUD‑assisted apartments near you. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\n- HUD Resource Locator: https://resources.hud.gov [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\nImportant:  \r\n\r\n- The Locator **does not** show current vacancies; you must call each property to ask about availability and waitlists. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n- HUD does not manage the waiting lists; each property has its own process. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\n[Citations]  \r\n\r\n### Tax Credit Properties (LIHTC)\r\n\r\nLow‑Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties make up a large share of affordable rentals in California. Developers receive tax credits in exchange for renting units at restricted rents to lower‑income households. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\n- LIHTC units have maximum income limits, but rents are not based on your exact income; they are set by the unit’s restrictions. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n- Many LIHTC properties accept Section 8 vouchers as payment and can be used with your voucher when you receive one. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\nHUD’s California page explains LIHTC properties and links to maps of tax credit properties.

[oxnard](https://www.oxnard.gov/housing/section-8)\r\n\r\n- **Project‑based Section 8**  \r\n  - Subsidy is attached to a specific building or unit.  \r\n  - You apply to the property; if accepted, your rent is income‑based, but if you move out you usually do not take the subsidy with you. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/states/california)\r\n\r\nMany California PHAs combine project‑based vouchers with affordable housing developments, so it can be easier to get into some project‑based units than to reach the top of a standard voucher waitlist.

You might not hit every step, and you can work on several at once.  \r\n\r\n1. **Call 211 → Enter Coordinated Entry**  \r\n   - Dial 211 or visit https://211ca.org to get connected to local shelters, outreach, and your CoC’s Coordinated Entry System. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)\r\n\r\n2. **Apply for County Housing Assistance**  \r\n   - Visit or contact your county DPSS/social services (for example, LA County DPSS: https://dpss.lacounty.gov) to apply for CalWORKs, General Relief, HSP, HA, and HDAP if you may qualify. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n\r\n3. **Stabilize with Temporary Aid**  \r\n   - Use motel vouchers, emergency shelter, and short‑term assistance (CalWORKs HA, HSP, HDAP) to get off the street and gather documents. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\n4. **Get Referred to Rapid Rehousing or Bridge Housing**  \r\n   - Through CES and county programs, seek referrals to rapid rehousing or bridge‑housing programs when your vulnerability and program fit line up with an opening. [nlihc](https://nlihc.org/node/94756)\r\n\r\n5. **Apply to All Open Section 8 Waitlists Statewide**  \r\n   - Regularly check HUD’s PHA contact list and major PHA websites (HACLA, SHRA, SDHC, etc.) for open waitlists and apply whenever you see an opening. [hacla](https://www.hacla.org/en/about-section-8/homeless-initiatives)\r\n\r\n6. **Apply to Tax Credit and Project‑Based Units**  \r\n   - Use HUD Resource Locator (https://resources.hud.gov), HUD’s California page, and tools like the California Affordable Housing Map (https://affordablehomes.chpc.net) to find and apply to LIHTC and project‑based properties. [affordablehomes.chpc](https://affordablehomes.chpc.net)\r\n\r\n7. **Maintain Documentation and Follow‑Ups**  \r\n   - Keep copies of your documents, track applications and case workers’ contact information, and check in regularly with your CES access point, county worker, and PHAs.

Many programs in California will ask for:  \r\n\r\n- **Photo ID** (state ID, driver’s license, or other government ID).  \r\n- **Social Security cards** or proof of having applied.  \r\n- **Income proof** (pay stubs, award letters for SSI/SSDI, CalWORKs, General Relief, unemployment, etc.).  \r\n- **Homeless verification letter** from a shelter, outreach worker, or agency, or documentation of staying in places not meant for habitation. [shastacounty](https://www.shastacounty.gov/media/8331)\r\n- **Disability verification** (for HDAP, SSI/SSDI applications, or supportive housing) – medical records or forms completed by a licensed provider.

In some areas there are frequent openings; in others, shelters are full and people wait days or weeks for a spot. Some state and county programs (like motel vouchers) have strict limits (for example, HA’s 16‑day limit) so you must plan for what comes next from day one.

It can take months or longer after your CES assessment before you receive a referral, and many people are never matched because demand is higher than supply.

Affordable housing properties also maintain their own waitlists, which can range from a few months to many years depending on location and unit size. [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)\r\n\r\nBecause of these realities, the best strategy is to treat housing as a long‑term process, keep your name on as many appropriate lists as possible, and use interim resources (shelters, rapid rehousing, county subsidies) to stay housed while you wait.  \r\n\r\n[Citations] [sdhc](https://sdhc.org/housing-opportunities/affordable-rentals/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 10: Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\nAvoiding these mistakes can protect your spot on waitlists and improve your chances of being housed.  \r\n\r\n1. **Waiting for one program only**  \r\n   - Relying on Section 8 alone or just one shelter program can leave you stuck for years; you should be in CES, county programs, and multiple waitlists at the same time. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)\r\n\r\n2. **Not applying in multiple counties or cities when possible**  \r\n   - Many PHAs and affordable properties in different counties have their own waitlists; you may be able to apply to several even if you don’t live there yet, depending on local preference rules. [affordablehomes.chpc](https://affordablehomes.chpc.net)\r\n\r\n3. **Not updating your contact information**  \r\n   - PHAs and property managers often send notices by mail or email; if they can’t reach you, they may remove you from the waitlist. Always update your address, phone, and email with CES, DPSS, and every housing provider where you applied. [hud](http://www.hud.gov/helping-americans/housing-choice-vouchers-tenants)\r\n\r\n4. **Missing document deadlines or appointments**  \r\n   - Many programs have strict timelines; missing an appointment or failing to turn in documents can close your case or move you down the list. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/housing-and-disability-advocacy-program)\r\n\r\n5. **Not opening mail or ignoring unfamiliar numbers**  \r\n   - Housing authorities and agencies may call from blocked or unfamiliar numbers and send important letters that look generic. Open all mail, keep a folder for housing letters, and check voicemail regularly.  \r\n\r\n6. **Not asking questions when you don’t understand**  \r\n   - Programs can be confusing; ask your case worker, shelter staff, or legal aid to explain your options, appeal rights, and what to expect next.

Coordinated Entry is often required for referrals to rapid rehousing, bridge housing, and permanent supportive housing, while county programs like CalWORKs HSP, HA, and HDAP can provide the temporary boost you need to get into a unit and stay there long enough to stabilize. [hudexchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/coordinated-entry/)\r\n\r\nThe system is slow and far from perfect, but many people do make it to stable housing by using a layered strategy: staying connected to CES, applying for all available benefits, getting on every appropriate waitlist, and protecting their rights with legal help when needed. With persistence, organization, and support, you can move step by step from crisis shelter toward a permanent home.

You can do them from a phone, shelter lobby, library, or hospital waiting room.  \r\n\r\n1. Call 211 to find a safe place to sleep and basic help  \r\n   - Dial 2-1-1 from any phone or visit https://211ca.org to be routed to your local 211. [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n   - In Los Angeles County, you can also call 2-1-1 or 800-339-6993 or use https://211la.org.

[211](http://www.211.org)\r\n   - If you’re in immediate danger or seriously hurt, call 911. If calling 911 doesn’t feel safe, consider 988 for crisis counseling and safety planning.

For urgent HIV, PEP/PrEP, or lost medications  \r\n   - PEP (post-exposure) must start within 72 hours after a possible HIV exposure; PrEP helps prevent HIV before exposure and is covered under Medi-Cal when medically necessary.

[211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n- Coordinated Entry is how counties match people experiencing homelessness to limited slots in shelter, bridge housing, rapid rehousing, or permanent supportive housing; you usually need an intake/assessment to get on the list. [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)\r\n- HUD-funded programs (including vouchers and supportive housing) run through local public housing agencies (PHAs) and homelessness systems; you can find PHAs and HUD-funded programs through HUD’s online resource and PHA locators.

[211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n\r\n2) ID + benefits setup  \r\n- Within the first 1–2 weeks, work with case managers at shelters, LGBTQ+ centers, or outreach programs to replace ID and apply for benefits.  \r\n- Use BenefitsCal to apply for Medi-Cal, CalFresh, and CalWORKs; these programs can stabilize food and health coverage while you focus on housing and work. [sonomacounty](https://sonomacounty.gov/health-and-human-services/human-services/apply-online-at-benefitscal)\r\n\r\n3) Medical stabilization (HIV care, mental health, SUD treatment)  \r\n- Once you have at least temporary shelter or a regular place to check in, connect with HIV/sexual health clinics, county behavioral health access lines, and SUD treatment programs.  \r\n- Ask for LGBTQ+ competent providers where possible; LA LGBT Center, APLA Health, AHF, and county clinics can coordinate HIV care, mental health, and substance use support. [dmh.lacounty](https://dmh.lacounty.gov/our-services/disaster-services/access-hotline/)\r\n\r\n4) Housing navigation (CES + housing programs)  \r\n- Complete Coordinated Entry assessments with outreach teams or access points; make sure your LGBTQ+ identity and health needs (including HIV, disability, and DV) are recorded so they can prioritize you appropriately. [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)\r\n- Stay in regular contact with your housing navigator and update them if your situation worsens (e.g., sleeping outside, safety threats). [homelessness.acgov](https://homelessness.acgov.org/coordinated-entry.page)\r\n\r\n5) Income (employment + training)  \r\n- When you have some stability, connect with AJCCs or LGBTQ+ center employment programs for job search, training, and placement support. [sfcenter](https://sfcenter.org)\r\n- Focus first on income that keeps you stably housed (even if it’s not your dream job), then look at longer-term training. [ajcc.lacounty](https://www.ajcc.lacounty.gov/ajcc)\r\n\r\n6) Long-term housing (vouchers, affordable housing, supportive housing)  \r\n- Work with case managers and housing navigators to apply for vouchers, project-based units, or supportive housing that fits your needs (e.g., HIV supportive housing, youth housing, or permanent supportive housing). [211la](https://211la.org/homeless-housing-support-programs)\r\n- Use SF LGBT Center’s financial counseling or similar services to plan for rent, debt, and credit, so you can keep housing once you get it.

[lambdalegal](https://lambdalegal.org/contact/)\r\n\r\n3) Missing waitlist mail or losing contact  \r\n- Housing programs often send letters or call once; if they can’t reach you, they may drop your spot.  \r\n- Use a stable mailing address (LGBTQ+ center, shelter, or PO box) and voicemail greeting, and check in regularly with your housing navigator. [sfcenter](https://www.sfcenter.org/program/housing-financial/)\r\n\r\n4) Not updating contact info  \r\n- Whenever you change phones, emails, or addresses, immediately update 211 referrals, case managers, clinics, and housing programs.  \r\n- You can usually update contact info by calling the program front desk or your county access line. [dmh.lacounty](https://dmh.lacounty.gov/get-help-now/)\r\n\r\n5) Thinking “one application solves everything”  \r\n- In California, you often need multiple applications: BenefitsCal for benefits, CES intake for housing, clinic intake for medical, AJCC intake for jobs, and separate legal intakes. [sonomacounty](https://sonomacounty.gov/health-and-human-services/human-services/apply-online-at-benefitscal)\r\n- Build a simple list (on paper or in your phone) of: which programs you applied to, dates, contact names, and when to follow up.

As of February 2026, the rules are detailed and can change, so always double‑check key points on official sites before you file. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Quick definitions: SSI, SSDI, and “disability”\r\n\r\n### What is SSDI?\r\n\r\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a federal insurance program for people who worked and paid Social Security (FICA) taxes, then became disabled and can no longer work at a substantial level.  Your benefit amount is based on your past earnings, not on your current income or savings.  SSDI is part of the larger Social Security program that also pays retirement and survivors benefits. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n\r\n### What is SSI?\r\n\r\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) is a needs‑based program for people with very low income and limited resources who are age 65 or older, blind, or disabled.  SSI is not based on your work history; it is funded by general tax revenues and meant to help pay for basic needs like food and shelter.  In California, SSI is combined with a state payment called SSP (State Supplementary Payment), which slightly increases the monthly benefit to reflect the high cost of living. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\n### What counts as “disabled” for SSDI/SSI?\r\n\r\nFor adults, Social Security uses the same strict definition of disability for both SSDI and SSI: \r\n\r\n- You have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment.\r\n- The condition is severe and has lasted or is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death.\r\n- Because of it, you cannot perform “substantial gainful activity” (SGA) — basically, you cannot work and earn above a set monthly amount. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\nCalifornia’s Disability Determination Services (DDS) applies this federal definition when it reviews your medical evidence and decides your case. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n\r\n**Key sources for definitions and basics:**\r\n\r\n- SSA Disability overview: https://www.ssa.gov/disability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- SSA Red Book disability overview: https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- USAGov SSI/SSDI overview: https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n- CA SSDI/SSI info: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n\r\n [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Main differences between SSI and SSDI\r\n\r\nAt a glance, the biggest differences are: where the money comes from, who qualifies, and how much you get. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\n- SSDI: Insurance based on your work and FICA taxes; no asset limit; benefit amount depends on your earnings record. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- SSI: Needs‑based; strict income and resource limits; flat federal benefit plus a California supplement. [ca4ssi](http://ca4ssi.org/the-basics)\r\n\r\n### SSI vs SSDI – side‑by‑side (California)\r\n\r\n| Feature | SSI | SSDI |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Basic purpose | Needs‑based cash benefit for low‑income people who are 65+, blind, or disabled.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) | Insurance benefit for people who worked and paid Social Security taxes, then became disabled.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability) |\r\n| Funding source | General federal funds, plus California State Supplementary Payment (SSP).  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) | Social Security trust funds funded by payroll taxes (FICA).  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability) |\r\n| Work history required? | No work credits required.  [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability) | Yes; you must have enough recent work credits based on age.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability) |\r\n| Income limits | Very strict countable income limits; benefits reduced as income goes up.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) | No income/resource test, but you generally cannot earn above SGA from work and still be considered disabled.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) |\r\n| Resource (asset) limits | Countable resources generally must be ≤ 2,000 (single) or 3,000 (couple), with some exclusions.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) | No resource limit for the federal program.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) |\r\n| California supplement? | Yes; California adds SSP to the federal SSI amount.  [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp) | No California SSP with SSDI.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) |\r\n| Health coverage link | In California, SSI recipients are typically automatically eligible for Medi‑Cal (California’s Medicaid).  [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp) | SSDI recipients generally qualify for Medicare after 24 months of entitlement (earlier for some conditions like ALS).  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) |\r\n| When benefits can start | First full month after application date or date you’re found eligible, whichever is later.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) | After a 5‑month waiting period from the established disability onset date; payments start in the 6th full month.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm) |\r\n| Back pay basics | Cannot be paid for months before your application’s effective date.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm) | May get retroactive benefits back to a limited time before you applied, based on onset date; rules are technical and case‑specific.  [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability) |\r\n| Paid to children? | Some disabled children with low‑income families can qualify for SSI.  [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability) | Children may receive dependents benefits on a disabled worker’s record (different rules than SSI child disability).

[cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n\r\nYou generally must:\r\n\r\n- Be 65 or older, or blind, or meet SSA’s adult or child disability definition. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- Have very limited income and resources within SSI rules. [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n- Be a U.S. citizen or certain eligible noncitizen. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- Live in the U.S. and not be absent for a full calendar month or 30 consecutive days. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\nCalifornia then adds SSP on top of the federal SSI payment, so your combined benefit is higher than the federal minimum.  The state’s SSI/SSP program is administered through the California Department of Social Services, but you still apply through Social Security. [ca4ssi](http://ca4ssi.org/the-basics)\r\n\r\nCalifornia‑specific notes:\r\n\r\n- California does *not* have a separate state SSI application; SSA handles eligibility and payments that include the SSP amount. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n- Certain living arrangements in California (for example, licensed residential care facilities) have specific SSI/SSP “facility rates,” and facilities are limited in what they can charge SSI recipients.

[ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\nYou must generally:\r\n\r\n- Have a medical condition that meets SSA’s definition of disability. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- Have enough “work credits” from jobs where you paid Social Security taxes, and some of those credits must be recent. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- Be insured under Social Security at the time you became disabled (your “date last insured” must not have passed). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\nWork credits:  \r\n\r\n- You earn up to four credits per year based on your earnings; the dollar amount needed per credit changes annually. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- Most adults need 20 credits earned in the 10 years just before disability, but younger workers need fewer. The exact requirement depends on your age when you became disabled. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\nExample: A person in their late 30s or 40s who worked full‑time for five years before becoming disabled will usually have enough credits. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\nSSDI is federal; California does not change the work‑credit rules but does handle the medical review through its DDS. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n\r\n**Key SSDI links:**\r\n\r\n- SSA Disability/SSDI overview: https://www.ssa.gov/disability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- SSDI online application: https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n- Work credits explanation (via SSA disability pages and online tools): https://www.ssa.gov/disability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\n [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Can you get both? (Concurrent benefits)\r\n\r\nSome Californians receive **both** SSDI and SSI at the same time. This is called “concurrent” benefits. [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\nYou might qualify for concurrent benefits if:\r\n\r\n- Your SSDI check is low (for example, because you had low‑wage or short work history). [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n- Your countable income and resources are still low enough to meet SSI limits. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\nIn that situation:\r\n\r\n- SSDI is paid based on your work record. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- SSI/SSP “tops up” your income up to the allowed level for California. [ca4ssi](http://ca4ssi.org/the-basics)\r\n\r\nConcurrent cases are fairly common among people with part‑time work histories or long breaks from work due to illness. [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n- SSA disability programs overview: https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- USAGov SSI vs SSDI overview: https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\n [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## What you need before applying (checklist)\r\n\r\nHaving documents ready makes the process smoother, especially if you’re applying online from California. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\nBefore you apply for SSDI or SSI, gather:\r\n\r\n- **Personal ID:** Social Security number, birth certificate or other proof of age, and proof of citizenship or immigration status. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n- **Marital and family info:** Names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth for your spouse and minor children; dates of marriage/divorce. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n- **Work history:** Names and addresses of employers for the last 2–5 years, job titles, and a summary of what you did (lifting, standing, supervising, etc.). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n- **Income and resources:** Bank account numbers for direct deposit; information about pensions, workers’ compensation, other benefits, and assets (for SSI). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n- **Medical providers:** Names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of visits for all doctors, clinics, hospitals, therapists, and mental health providers. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- **Medical evidence:** Lists of diagnoses, medications (names, doses), tests (MRIs, X‑rays, labs), and treatments. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- **Functional information:** Notes about how your condition limits your daily activities (sitting, standing, walking, concentrating, self‑care). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\nSSA offers an Adult Disability Checklist you can print and use to make sure you have everything. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\n**Useful links:**\r\n\r\n- Adult Disability Checklist and online application: https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n- SSI application process: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n\r\n [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Step‑by‑step: How to apply for SSDI\r\n\r\nYou can apply for SSDI from anywhere in California online, by phone, or in person at your local Social Security office. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Apply online (recommended for most adults)\r\n\r\n1. Go to SSA’s disability application page: https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n2. Review the Adult Disability Checklist and gather your documents. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n3. Create or sign in to your **my Social Security** account. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/blog/en/posts/2025-06-12.html)\r\n4. Complete the online Disability Benefit Application and related medical forms. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n5. Submit the electronic medical release form so SSA can request your records. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n6. Keep your confirmation number and regularly check your my Social Security account and mail for updates. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/blog/en/posts/2025-06-12.html)\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Apply by phone\r\n\r\n1. Call SSA’s national number: 1‑800‑772‑1213 (TTY 1‑800‑325‑0778) Monday–Friday, 8 a.m.–7 p.m. local time. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n2. Ask to apply for **Social Security Disability Insurance**. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n3. SSA may complete the application by phone or schedule you for a phone appointment. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n\r\n### Option 3: Apply in person (California office)\r\n\r\n1. Find your local SSA office using the office locator: https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n2. Call ahead to schedule an appointment if possible. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n3. Bring your documents and be prepared to answer detailed questions about your work and medical history. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n\r\n### How long does SSDI take?\r\n\r\n- Initial decisions often take several months; many cases run 3–6 months or longer, depending on medical complexity and how quickly records are received. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- If approved, benefits usually begin after the 5‑month waiting period from your established onset date, and you may receive back pay. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\n**Key SSDI application links:**\r\n\r\n- Apply for disability benefits (SSDI online): https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n- How to apply for disability benefits: https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n\r\n [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Step‑by‑step: How to apply for SSI (and what’s different)\r\n\r\nSSI applications are more tied to interviews and income/resource review, and not everyone can do a full SSI application entirely online yet. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/blog/en/posts/2025-06-12.html)\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Start online\r\n\r\n1. Visit SSA’s SSI page: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n2. Use the SSI online application portal: https://www.ssa.gov/apply/ssi. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/apply/ssi)\r\n3. If you qualify to apply online (for example, you are 18–64, applying for both SSDI and SSI, and meet certain criteria), complete the online forms and submit. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/apply/ssi)\r\n4. SSA may still contact you for additional information or an interview about income and resources. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/blog/en/posts/2025-06-12.html)\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Phone or local office (very common)\r\n\r\n1. Call 1‑800‑772‑1213 and tell SSA you want to apply for **Supplemental Security Income**. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n2. Ask them to **protect your filing date** and schedule an appointment (phone or in person). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n3. On your appointment date, complete the application and financial questions with the SSA representative. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n\r\n### What’s different about SSI vs SSDI applications?\r\n\r\n- SSI requires detailed questions about household income, living arrangements, and resources, because it is means‑tested. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n- Your California SSI payment includes the SSP amount automatically; you do *not* submit a separate state SSI/SSP form. [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n- Timing matters: SSI generally cannot pay for months before your application’s effective date, so apply as soon as possible. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n\r\n**Key SSI application links:**\r\n\r\n- SSI overview: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- Start SSI application process: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n- Apply for SSI (adult/child portal): https://www.ssa.gov/apply/ssi [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/apply/ssi)\r\n\r\n [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/apply/ssi)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## What happens after you apply (California DDS, exams, timelines)\r\n\r\nOnce you file your SSDI or SSI claim, SSA sends your case to **Disability Determination Services** (DDS) for California, a state agency that makes the medical decision. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n\r\n### Role of California DDS\r\n\r\n- Reviews your application and disability report from SSA. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- Requests medical records from your doctors, hospitals, clinics, and mental health providers. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- Evaluates how your impairments limit your ability to do past work or adjust to other work, following SSA’s rules. [jonathanpena](https://www.jonathanpena.com/understanding-disability-determination-services-dds-in-california-how-to-qualify-for-benefits/)\r\n- May schedule a **consultative examination (CE)** with a doctor contracted by SSA if your records are incomplete. [jonathanpena](https://www.jonathanpena.com/understanding-disability-determination-services-dds-in-california-how-to-qualify-for-benefits/)\r\n\r\n### Timelines\r\n\r\n- Many initial decisions take 3–6 months, but complex cases or slow medical records can make it longer. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- If DDS denies your claim, SSA will mail you a written decision explaining the reasons and your appeal rights. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\nCalifornia DDS is under the California Department of Social Services, but it must follow federal rules and SSA’s definition of disability.

[ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n\r\nHelpful steps:\r\n\r\n- **Get consistent medical care.** Regular treatment notes from doctors, specialists, and therapists are powerful evidence. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- **Describe function, not just diagnosis.** Explain how your condition affects standing, walking, lifting, focusing, following instructions, and daily self‑care. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- **Respond to forms and calls quickly.** Return SSA questionnaires and attend any consultative exams; missing them can lead to denial. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- **Update SSA on changes.** If you move, change doctors, or have a new serious diagnosis, inform SSA so DDS can obtain the new records. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\nSSA’s Adult Disability Checklist and online materials give examples of the kind of information they are looking for. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n- SSA disability determination process: https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- Adult Disability Checklist: https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\n [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10550.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## If you’re denied: appeals roadmap and deadlines\r\n\r\nMany Californians are denied at first but later win on appeal, especially if they provide more evidence or get representation. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n### Basic appeal levels\r\n\r\n1. **Reconsideration**  \r\n   - Deadline: You generally have 60 days from the date you receive the denial letter to request reconsideration. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n   - What it is: A different DDS examiner reviews your case and any new evidence. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n2. **Hearing by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)**  \r\n   - If reconsideration is denied, you can request a hearing with an ALJ. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n   - You can appear by video, phone, or in person; many people use attorneys or representatives at this stage. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n3. **Appeals Council review**  \r\n   - If you disagree with the ALJ decision, you can ask the Appeals Council to review it. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n4. **Federal court**  \r\n   - After the Appeals Council, you may file a case in federal district court. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\nYou can usually appeal online through SSA’s appeals portal or by contacting your local office.  Missing the 60‑day deadline can cause you to lose appeal rights, so act quickly. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n**Appeals resources:**\r\n\r\n- SSA appeals info: https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/appeal.html (linked from disability pages) [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n- SSA disability determination process summary: https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Where to get free/low‑cost help in California\r\n\r\nYou do not have to do this alone. In California there are multiple places to get information and representation.\r\n\r\nCommon options:\r\n\r\n- **Legal aid organizations and disability advocates.** Many Legal Aid and Disability Rights groups offer free or low‑cost help with SSI/SSDI; they are not all on one state list, so search by county or call 211. (Availability and capacity vary.)  \r\n- **California Department of Social Services.** Provides information on SSDI/SSI and links to SSA’s site; they do not process the applications but can help with related state benefits questions. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n- **SSA itself.** SSA staff can explain forms and processes (but not give legal advice); call 1‑800‑772‑1213 or contact your local office. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n- **211 California.** Dial 211 or visit your local 211 website to find legal aid, social services, and disability advocacy programs in your county. (211 is a nationwide information and referral system; coverage is broad but not identical in every area.)  \r\n\r\nFor facility‑related SSI questions (for example, if you or a family member lives in a residential care facility), California nonprofit resources that focus on long‑term care can provide guidance based on state rules. [canhr](https://canhr.org/supplemental-security-income-ssi-in-rcfes/)\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n- CA SSDI/SSI info (CDSS): https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi)\r\n- SSA contact and office locator: https://www.ssa.gov/locator and 1‑800‑772‑1213 [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n\r\n [canhr](https://canhr.org/supplemental-security-income-ssi-in-rcfes/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Common confusion: SSDI vs retirement, SSI vs “welfare,” work rules\r\n\r\n### SSDI vs Social Security retirement\r\n\r\n- SSDI and Social Security retirement use the same earnings record but are different programs. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- If you get SSDI, when you reach full retirement age your benefits usually convert to retirement benefits, often at the same amount. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n- People who are already at full retirement age typically apply for retirement, not SSDI. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\n### Is SSI just “welfare”?\r\n\r\n- SSI is a federal means‑tested program paid from general tax revenues, not Social Security taxes. [specialneedsanswers](https://specialneedsanswers.com/three-big-differences-between-ssi-and-ssdi-14866)\r\n- It is often grouped with “safety net” programs, but it has its own national rules and strict disability and age criteria. [specialneedsanswers](https://specialneedsanswers.com/three-big-differences-between-ssi-and-ssdi-14866)\r\n\r\n### Can you work while on SSDI or SSI?\r\n\r\nWork rules are complex and can change, so always check current SSA guidance. [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\n- **SSDI:** You generally must stay under “substantial gainful activity” (SGA) earnings, but SSA has work incentives such as trial work periods and extended periods of eligibility. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- **SSI:** Earnings reduce your payment, but not dollar‑for‑dollar. SSA ignores part of your income; above that, your SSI is reduced according to formulas. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\nSSA’s Red Book explains work incentives and trial work periods in detail. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\n**Key links:**\r\n\r\n- SSA Disability overview and work incentives (Red Book): https://www.ssa.gov/redbook [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n- USAGov disability info: https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\n [usa](https://www.usa.gov/social-security-disability)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## FAQ (California‑focused)\r\n\r\n**1. Do I apply for SSI and SSDI separately in California?**  \r\nNo. You apply through SSA, and they screen you for SSDI and SSI; if you qualify for both, they process a concurrent claim.  California’s SSP portion is built into the SSI/SSP payment—no separate state application. [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n\r\n**2. Does California automatically give Medi‑Cal if I get SSI?**  \r\nIn California, SSI eligibility generally makes you automatically eligible for Medi‑Cal, though there can be administrative steps to coordinate the coverage.  Always confirm with your county Medi‑Cal office, since health coverage procedures can change. (Details are often handled at the county level.) [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n\r\n**3. Can I apply for disability online if I don’t have a printer or scanner?**  \r\nYes. You can complete the online SSDI application without printing or scanning; you only need access to the internet and your information.  SSA provides an electronic medical release form as part of the process. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n\r\n**4. I live in Los Angeles. Do I have to go to downtown SSA?**  \r\nNot necessarily. You can apply online or by phone from anywhere in Los Angeles County.  If you want in‑person help, use SSA’s office locator to find the nearest office and call for an appointment. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/disability.html)\r\n\r\n**5. How far back can SSDI pay me if I win?**  \r\nSSDI back pay depends on your established onset date and the 5‑month waiting period; SSA can sometimes pay retroactive benefits for a limited time before you applied, but the exact rules are technical.  SSI cannot pay for months before your application’s effective date. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n\r\n**6. Do I lose SSDI when I hit retirement age?**  \r\nYour SSDI typically converts to a Social Security retirement benefit at full retirement age, usually for about the same amount; it does not simply stop. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/disability)\r\n\r\n**7. What if I don’t have all my medical records?**  \r\nApply anyway. SSA and California DDS can request records from your providers once you sign the medical release; they may also send you to a consultative exam if needed. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n\r\n**8. How often will they review my case?**  \r\nSSA sets a “diary date” for continuing disability reviews based on how likely improvement is expected, for both SSI and SSDI cases.  This can range from every few years to longer intervals. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n- SSI apply process: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-apply-ussi.htm)\r\n- Disability application online: https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/index.htm)\r\n- CA SSI/SSP and SSDI/SSI info: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp and https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ssdi-ssi [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n\r\n [cdss.ca](https://cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ssi-ssp)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Conclusion: Next steps if you’re in California\r\n\r\nIf you are in California and think you may qualify for SSI, SSDI, or both, your best next steps are to gather your documents, open a **my Social Security** account, and either start the online disability application or call SSA to protect your filing date.  Keep in mind that as of February 2026, rules and amounts can change over time, so always verify key details on SSA and California Department of Social Services websites before relying on them.

You are not alone, and there are real people and programs in California ready to help you stay safer, find housing, and rebuild your life. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## SECTION 1: IF YOU ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER\r\n\r\nIf you believe you or your children are in immediate danger, treat this as an emergency.\r\n\r\n- Call 911 from any phone. You can ask for police and say: “I am experiencing domestic violence and I’m afraid for my safety.”  \r\n- If you can’t safely talk, in many places you can leave the line open and the dispatcher may send help if they hear disturbance; you can also say “Yes/No” or short phrases like “send police.” Responses can vary by county, so stay on the line as long as it’s safe.\r\n\r\n### National Domestic Violence Hotline (24/7, confidential, all genders)\r\n\r\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline can help you with safety planning, emotional support, and referrals anywhere in California. Services are free and confidential. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n\r\n- Phone: **1‑800‑799‑SAFE (1‑800‑799‑7233)** [acf](https://acf.gov/acf-hotlines-helplines)\r\n- TTY: **1‑800‑787‑3224** [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n- Text: **Text “START” to 88788** [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n- Online chat: **https://www.thehotline.org** (click “Chat Now”) [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n\r\nYou can tell them if you are in California, if you are LGBTQ+, undocumented, disabled, or a parent; they can help find local resources that respect your situation. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n\r\n### Safety planning basics (quick version)\r\n\r\nA safety plan is a personalized plan to reduce risk when things escalate, when you leave, and after you leave. Hotlines and local advocates can help you build one in detail, but here are basics: [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n\r\n- Identify safe rooms and exits (rooms with doors and windows, away from weapons).  \r\n- Keep a small go‑bag where you can grab it quickly: IDs, birth certificates, Social Security numbers, bank cards, immigration documents, medications, keys, phone charger, a change of clothes, and important numbers written on paper.  \r\n- Teach children simple safety steps: how to call 911, a code word that means “go to a safe place,” and who they can run to (neighbor, store, school).  \r\n- Plan how you would leave quickly (where you’d go first: friend, shelter, hospital, police station).  \r\n\r\nA hotline advocate can walk through this with you step by step, including for people who must use mobility devices, have chronic illness, or depend financially on the abuser. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n\r\n### Technology safety tips\r\n\r\nAbusers often misuse technology to monitor, stalk, or harass. National DV Hotline offers technology safety guidance.  Basic steps: [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n\r\n- Assume your phone, email, or social media **could** be monitored until proven otherwise.  \r\n- Whenever possible, use a safer device your partner cannot access (a friend’s phone, library computer, or work device) for searching for help, changing passwords, or contacting services. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n- Change passwords and PINs (email, banking, social media, cloud backups) on a safe device; use passcodes your partner cannot guess.  \r\n- Turn off location sharing in apps (Find My, Google Maps, Snapchat, Life360); check Bluetooth devices and unknown apps.  \r\n- If your partner has access to your phone plan, they might see call/text history; consider using hotlines’ chat or text from a different device. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n- After you get to safety, ask an advocate about checking for stalkerware/spyware.\r\n\r\nThe California courts and DV sites also remind survivors that website history can show up to an abuser, and they encourage clearing browser history and using “private” or “incognito” windows when you search for help. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n### Confidential shelter options\r\n\r\nDomestic violence shelters in California typically provide: [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n\r\n- Safe, confidential locations.  \r\n- Beds for adults and children; many shelters accept men, LGBTQ+ survivors, and people with disabilities. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)\r\n- Case management, safety planning, help with restraining orders, and referrals for housing and legal aid. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)\r\n- Basic needs: food, clothing, hygiene items. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n\r\nWays to access shelter:\r\n\r\n- Call the **National Domestic Violence Hotline** (1‑800‑799‑7233) and ask for DV shelter referrals in your county. [acf](https://acf.gov/acf-hotlines-helplines)\r\n- Call your local 211 to be connected with DV shelters and homeless services (see Section 3). [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n- In Los Angeles, Orange, or San Diego Counties, you can also call the regional DV hotlines and shelters listed in Sections 4–6 for direct intake. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)\r\n\r\n**Key sources (Section 1):**  \r\n- National Domestic Violence Hotline – https://www.thehotline.org – 1‑800‑799‑7233 [acf](https://acf.gov/acf-hotlines-helplines)\r\n- California Courts Self‑Help (general online safety warnings) – https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n- 211 California – https://211ca.org [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n- 211 LA – https://211la.org [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## SECTION 2: FIRST 72 HOURS AFTER ABUSE\r\n\r\nYou might feel shock, numbness, guilt, or confusion. All of those reactions are normal trauma responses. During the first 72 hours, focus on safety and preserving options for the future.\r\n\r\n### Medical care and documentation\r\n\r\nEven if you don’t have visible injuries, it’s often wise to see a doctor, urgent care, or emergency room. Medical records can serve as evidence later and help keep you safer. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n- Tell the provider you experienced domestic violence so they can document injuries and note your concerns.  \r\n- Ask for copies of medical records or discharge papers; keep them in a safe place or with a trusted person. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n- If you were strangled (even without marks), have headaches, confusion, or vision changes, seek emergency care immediately—strangulation can be life‑threatening. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n\r\nYou can ask a DV advocate to help you get to a clinic or hospital; many shelters and county programs help with transportation. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)\r\n\r\n### Restraining orders in California (how and where to file)\r\n\r\nIn California, a **Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO)** is a civil court order that can order an abuser to stop abuse, stay away, move out, and follow other rules; it can also address child custody and support. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n- The California Courts Self‑Help site has a step‑by‑step guide: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n- LawHelpCA also has plain‑language guides on domestic violence restraining orders: https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n\r\nTypical steps: [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n1. Get the forms:  \r\n   - From your county superior court’s self‑help center or website, or online at the California Courts site. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n2. Fill them out:  \r\n   - Include specific incidents, dates (if you can), injuries, threats, and include children or household members who also need protection. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n3. Turn them in (“file”):  \r\n   - File at the family law clerk’s office in your county. There is usually **no filing fee** for DVROs. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n4. Temporary order:  \r\n   - A judge usually reviews your request the same or next business day and may grant a **Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)** that lasts until your court hearing (usually within weeks). [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n5. Service:  \r\n   - Someone 18 or older, **not you**, must hand‑deliver the papers to the abuser (“serve” them). Sheriffs in many counties will serve DVROs for free. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n6. Hearing:  \r\n   - At the hearing, the judge decides whether to give a longer‑term order that can last up to 5 years. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\nLocal DV advocates and legal aid can help you fill out forms, ask for custody and support orders, and prepare for court. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence.html)\r\n\r\n### Evidence preservation\r\n\r\nYou do not have to decide right now whether to report to police or go to court. But preserving evidence gives you options. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n- Save photos of injuries, damaged property, weapons, and screenshots of threatening texts, emails, or social media; back them up to a secure cloud account or trusted friend’s device.  \r\n- Keep a simple incident log: dates, what happened, witnesses, and what children saw or heard.  \r\n- Save medical records, police reports, and any prior restraining orders. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n- Do not edit or delete abusive messages if you might use them in court; instead, screenshot and then consider blocking if needed for safety.  \r\n\r\nHotline and local advocates can help you think about what evidence is most helpful and how to store it safely. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n\r\n### Talking to children about safety\r\n\r\nChildren may see or hear more than you realize. It’s not your fault, and you can still help them feel safer.

My job is to keep us safe.”  \r\n- Teach them:  \r\n  - Where they can go in the house to stay safer (away from violence).  \r\n  - How to call 911 (if it’s safe in your situation) and what to say.  \r\n  - A code word that means “go to the safe place” or “call for help.”  \r\n- Reassure them that many families get help, and they can talk to a counselor or advocate too. Many DV shelters provide children’s counseling and support groups.

[dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence/shelters.html)\r\n- **Friends/family**: If this is your plan, discuss safety (no sharing your exact location with the abuser, blocking social media check‑ins).  \r\n- **Hotels/motels**: Some county programs (especially through CalWORKs Homeless Assistance) can help with short‑term motel stays when homelessness is due to domestic violence. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)\r\n\r\nTo find safe housing quickly:\r\n\r\n- Call the National DV Hotline (1‑800‑799‑7233).

[211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)\r\n- Call county‑specific DV shelters and hotlines listed in Sections 4–6. [a77.asmdc](https://a77.asmdc.org/resources-survivors-domestic-violence)\r\n\r\n### How to contact local DV advocates\r\n\r\nDomestic violence advocates can sit with you (in person or by phone), talk through your options, help with restraining orders, and connect you to housing and benefits. [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)\r\n\r\n- Use the **National DV Hotline**’s provider directory: https://www.thehotline.org – click “Get Help” then “Find Local Resources” (directory link). [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n- Use **California Partnership to End Domestic Violence**’s “Find Help” page to locate DV organizations by county: https://www.cpedv.org (navigate to resources for survivors).

[ocwomenshealth](https://www.ocwomenshealth.org/resources/dv)\r\n\r\n- Dial **2‑1‑1** from any phone in most California counties.  \r\n- Or visit **https://211ca.org** and enter your ZIP code to connect with your local 211. [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n- Services are available in multiple languages and are open to everyone, including undocumented people and LGBTQ+ survivors. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)\r\n\r\nIn Orange County, you can also use **211OC** directly at https://211oc.org. [211oc](https://211oc.org)\r\n\r\nWhen you call, you can say, “I am experiencing domestic violence and I need confidential shelter and legal/housing resources.”\r\n\r\n### Coordinated Entry for DV survivors\r\n\r\nMany California communities use “Coordinated Entry” to connect people experiencing homelessness to shelter, transitional housing, and rapid rehousing. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)\r\n\r\nFor domestic violence survivors:\r\n\r\n- There is often a **separate, confidential pathway** for DV survivors so your information is not shared broadly through the general homeless system. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)\r\n- 211 or a DV hotline typically does a **screening** to see if you should be referred through the DV‑specific Coordinated Entry system (for example, to DV shelters or DV‑specific rapid rehousing). [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n\r\nTell them clearly you are a **survivor of domestic violence** and you are concerned about confidentiality.\r\n\r\n### How to request confidential shelter\r\n\r\nWhen you call a hotline, 211, or shelter:\r\n\r\n- Start with safety: “Is this a confidential line?” (Most DV hotlines are.) [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n- Say only what you are comfortable sharing at first; you can give more details as you feel safer.  \r\n- You do **not** have to prove abuse on the phone; they will ask questions to understand risk and match you with appropriate services. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)\r\n\r\nIf they are full, ask:\r\n\r\n- “Do you know another DV shelter that might have space?”  \r\n- “Is there a DV‑specific motel voucher or homeless program I can be referred to?” (Especially if you are or may be eligible for CalWORKs.) [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n\r\n### What information you’ll likely need\r\n\r\nIt’s okay if you don’t have everything, but having some of this ready can help:\r\n\r\n- Your first name (you may be able to use a nickname if needed for safety).  \r\n- Number of adults and children needing shelter, ages, and any special needs or disabilities. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n- Whether the abuser knows your car, phone, or usual routes.  \r\n- Whether you have pets (some shelters are pet‑friendly or work with pet foster programs).  \r\n- Any urgent medical or mental health needs.  \r\n\r\nYou can ask, “What information do you actually need, and what can I leave out for safety?”\r\n\r\n### What happens during intake\r\n\r\nIntake is the process where a hotline or shelter gathers information and decides if they can offer you a bed or other help. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)\r\n\r\n- You talk with an advocate who asks about safety, recent incidents, children, and any health needs.  \r\n- If they have space, they’ll explain how to get there; locations are usually kept confidential, and you might meet staff at a neutral spot first. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n- If they’re full, they may call other shelters with you, refer you to motel vouchers, or put you on a waiting list. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)\r\n- Once you arrive, you’ll sign confidentiality and house agreements and meet with a case manager to talk about housing, legal options, benefits, and safety planning.

[lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n- In some cases, break a lease early because of domestic violence with proper documentation, without typical penalties (state civil code provisions on DV and leases). [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n- Be free from housing discrimination based on being a victim of domestic violence, especially in subsidized housing and under certain fair housing laws. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n\r\nBecause details change, use LawHelpCA and local legal aid to get the latest on tenant protections and how they apply in your situation. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n### Safe at Home – California Address Confidentiality Program\r\n\r\n**Safe at Home** is California’s statewide confidential address program, run by the Secretary of State. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home)\r\n\r\n- Website: **https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home** [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/frequently-asked-questions)\r\n- It provides a **substitute mailing address** and mail forwarding for survivors of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, elder/dependent abuse, and some others. [amadorcounty](https://www.amadorcounty.gov/government/elections/safe-at-home)\r\n- The program can help keep your home address out of many public records and can be used with certain government agencies, voter registration, and sometimes property records. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/frequently-asked-questions)\r\n- Participants may also access added protections like DMV records suppression and the ability to petition for a confidential name change related to domestic violence. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/frequently-asked-questions)\r\n\r\nSafe at Home is most effective as part of a broader safety plan, and a DV advocate can help you apply. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSuUcF98Us)\r\n\r\n### Employment protections for DV survivors in California\r\n\r\nCalifornia law protects workers who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and other qualifying acts of violence. These protections have been expanding, including through **AB 406** (effective late 2025 and 2026). [cdflaborlaw](https://www.cdflaborlaw.com/blog/key-new-2026-employment-laws-for-california-employers)\r\n\r\nKey protections include:\r\n\r\n- Employers may **not retaliate or discriminate** against you because you are a victim or because a family member is a victim, if the employer knows about it. [legiscan](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB406/id/3259530)\r\n- You may have the right to **take time off** (paid or unpaid, depending on policy) to:  \r\n  - Seek medical attention.  \r\n  - Get a restraining order or other crime‑related relief.  \r\n  - Attend court hearings or meet with prosecutors.  \r\n  - Seek services from DV shelters, counselors, or victim advocates. [ogletree](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/california-expands-leave-and-protections-for-victims-of-violence/)\r\n- Employers must provide **reasonable safety accommodations**, such as schedule changes, transfers, locks on doors, changes in work phone or location, or other measures to keep you safer at work. [legiscan](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB406/id/3259530)\r\n- You may use paid sick leave (“safe time”) for certain crime‑related absences. [spencerfane](https://www.spencerfane.com/insight/golden-state-gotchas-your-2026-california-employment-law-guide/)\r\n\r\nIf your employer violates these rights, you can contact legal aid or the California Civil Rights Department (through LawHelpCA for referrals).

You might move through one or several of these.\r\n\r\n### Emergency shelter\r\n\r\nEmergency DV shelter is usually the first step for many survivors who cannot safely stay where they are. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n\r\n- Length of stay often runs around 30–45 days; policies vary by agency. [ocfjcfoundation](https://www.ocfjcfoundation.org/dv-shelters/)\r\n- Services: safety planning, legal advocacy, help with benefits and CalWORKs, counseling, and housing search planning. [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)\r\n- Access: through DV hotlines, 211, and sometimes law enforcement or hospitals. [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n\r\n### Transitional housing\r\n\r\nTransitional housing gives more time (months to up to 2 years in some programs) to stabilize work and healing. [ocfjcfoundation](https://www.ocfjcfoundation.org/dv-shelters/)\r\n\r\n- Some DV agencies in LA, Orange, and San Diego Counties offer transitional housing specifically for DV survivors (for example, programs linked to 1736, Laura’s House, Human Options, and YWCA). [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)\r\n- Residents usually work on savings plans, employment, and longer‑term housing. [211la](https://211la.org/services/HxlQ1AxL6Cq9168rf5NGg3LIP209Jv/domestic-violence-shelters)\r\n\r\n### Rapid rehousing (RRH)\r\n\r\nRapid rehousing helps you move into your own unit more quickly through short‑ to medium‑term rental assistance and case management.\r\n\r\n- Many communities have **DV‑specific rapid rehousing** funded by state and federal programs, accessed through DV agencies or coordinated entry. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)\r\n- 211 or your DV case manager can tell you if there is DV rapid rehousing in your county and how to be referred. [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n\r\n### CalWORKs Homeless Assistance (for eligible families)\r\n\r\nIf you are a parent with low income, you may qualify for **CalWORKs** (California’s cash aid program) and its **Homeless Assistance (HA)** component. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n\r\n- CalWORKs Homeless Assistance can provide:  \r\n  - Payments for temporary shelter (for example, motel stays) for up to **16 days**, once every 12 months (with some exceptions). [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n  - Help with security deposit and last month’s rent or rent arrears to obtain or keep permanent housing. [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n- Families fleeing domestic violence can be treated as homeless for CalWORKs HA eligibility based on their sworn statement, even if the abuser has income or assets. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n- CDSS CalWORKs Homeless Assistance info: https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n- LA County CalWORKs Homeless Programs & Services: https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)\r\n\r\nAsk your county welfare office or DV liaison: “I’m fleeing domestic violence—can I get CalWORKs and Homeless Assistance?”\r\n\r\n### Section 8 and longer‑term housing\r\n\r\n- If you already have a **Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher** or other subsidized housing, you may have rights to emergency transfers or portability because of domestic violence under federal and state protections. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n- If you don’t have a voucher, you can ask housing authorities and DV agencies if there are waitlist preferences or set‑asides for DV survivors. Policies vary by county and housing authority. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n\r\nUse LawHelpCA or a local legal aid/housing advocate to understand your specific rights with your landlord or voucher. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n\r\n### Safety planning for housing searches\r\n\r\nWhen you look for housing:\r\n\r\n- Consider distance from the abuser’s home, work, and family; think about bus routes and shared communities.  \r\n- Ask about building security (locks, cameras, secure entry); talk to your employer about keeping your work address confidential. [legiscan](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB406/id/3259530)\r\n- Ask an advocate if Safe at Home could protect your address in public records. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home)\r\n- Avoid putting your precise address on public online rental platforms; use email or P.O. box where possible.  \r\n\r\n**Key sources (Section 8):**  \r\n- CDSS – CalWORKs Homeless Assistance – https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance [cdss.ca](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance)\r\n- AB 557 summary on DV and CalWORKs homelessness – https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557 [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)\r\n- LA County CalWORKs Homeless Programs – https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)\r\n- 211 California – https://211ca.org [211ca](https://211ca.org)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## SECTION 9: HEALING AFTER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\r\n\r\nLeaving or surviving abuse is not just a legal or housing process; it’s an emotional and physical healing journey.\r\n\r\n### Trauma responses: fight, flight, freeze, fawn\r\n\r\nMany survivors notice they reacted in ways they don’t fully understand. Common trauma responses include:\r\n\r\n- **Fight**: arguing back, defending yourself, feeling intense anger.  \r\n- **Flight**: wanting to run away, avoiding, overworking, or constantly staying busy.  \r\n- **Freeze**: feeling numb, unable to move or speak, forgetting details, “going blank.”  \r\n- **Fawn**: trying to appease or please the abuser to survive, saying “yes” to things you don’t want, minimizing your own needs.  \r\n\r\nThese responses are **survival strategies**, not character flaws. Trauma‑informed counselors and DV advocates normalize and work gently with these patterns. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)\r\n\r\n### Counseling options\r\n\r\nYou deserve support that fits your identity and story.\r\n\r\n- Many DV agencies (Laura’s House, Human Options, Peace Over Violence, YWCA, etc.) offer free or low‑cost individual counseling, support groups, and trauma‑focused therapy. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)\r\n- Some offer specialized services for LGBTQ+ survivors, men, undocumented survivors, and survivors with disabilities. [domesticshelters](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help/ca/los-angeles)\r\n- You can ask 211 or the National DV Hotline to help you find a trauma‑informed therapist who understands domestic violence. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org)\r\n\r\nIf you have Medi‑Cal or other insurance, ask your plan for behavioral health providers with experience in trauma and domestic violence.\r\n\r\n### Support groups\r\n\r\nSupport groups can reduce isolation and shame.\r\n\r\n- Most DV organizations in LA, Orange, and San Diego counties offer in‑person or virtual support groups, some in Spanish and other languages. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)\r\n- Groups might focus on parenting after DV, LGBTQ+ survivors, immigrant survivors, or long‑term healing. [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)\r\n\r\nYou can ask, “Do you have groups for my specific situation?” (for example, male survivors, non‑binary survivors, parents, or survivors with chronic illness).\r\n\r\n### Rebuilding identity and boundaries\r\n\r\nAbuse often attacks your sense of self and your ability to say “no.”\r\n\r\n- Working with counselors and advocates, you can explore what **you** like, believe, and want, separate from the abuser. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)\r\n- Boundaries can start small: choosing who you respond to, how quickly, and what topics you’re willing to discuss.  \r\n- Many DV programs have empowerment classes (like Personal Empowerment Programs at Laura’s House) focused on rebuilding self‑worth and healthy relationship skills. [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)\r\n\r\n### Financial recovery steps\r\n\r\nFinancial abuse is extremely common—controlling money, sabotaging work, or forcing debt.\r\n\r\nSteps you can explore:\r\n\r\n- Open a new bank account in your own name at a different bank or credit union, if it’s safe.  \r\n- Pull your free credit report and look for accounts you don’t recognize.  \r\n- Ask DV advocates and legal aid about:  \r\n  - Removing the abuser from certain debts where possible.  \r\n  - Debt collection rights and protections if you are a DV survivor.  \r\n- If you have low income and children, apply for **CalWORKs**, CalFresh (food benefits), and other programs; DV liaisons can help you navigate safely. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)\r\n\r\n### Long‑term stability planning\r\n\r\nOver time, your plan can expand beyond crisis survival:\r\n\r\n- Stable housing: working toward transitional or permanent housing with or without subsidies. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)\r\n- Education and career: using job training, GED/college programs, or workforce development; some DV agencies partner with job programs. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence.html)\r\n- Ongoing emotional support: continuing therapy, peer support groups, or mentoring. [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)\r\n- Legal stability: finalizing custody, support, divorce, or immigration cases with help from legal aid. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\nHealing is not linear. It’s normal to have setbacks; staying connected to supportive people and services makes a big difference.\r\n\r\n**Key sources (Section 9):**  \r\n- National Domestic Violence Hotline – emotional support and education – https://www.thehotline.org [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n- California Partnership to End Domestic Violence – statewide coalition supporting trauma‑informed services – https://www.cpedv.org [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)\r\n- Laura’s House – counseling and empowerment programs – https://laurashouse.org [laurashouse](https://laurashouse.org)\r\n- YWCA Becky’s House – counseling and supportive services – https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0 [mentalhealth.networkofcare](https://mentalhealth.networkofcare.org/sandiego/services/agency?pid=ywcaofsandiegocountybeckyshouseemergencyshelter_61_2_0)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## SECTION 10: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\r\n\r\nNo one is perfect in a crisis, and you are doing the best you can. These are common pitfalls that can make things harder later; knowing them lets you plan around them.\r\n\r\n### Going back without a safety plan\r\n\r\nMany survivors leave and return multiple times; this is common and often related to safety, finances, or children.\r\n\r\n- If you think you might return, talk with an advocate first about a safety plan for returning and leaving again if needed. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n- A safety plan can cover where to hide documents, how to teach children warning signs, and how to keep contact with advocates even if you go back. [thehotline](https://www.thehotline.org/what-to-expect-when-you-contact-us/)\r\n\r\n### Not documenting abuse\r\n\r\nYou might feel tempted to forget and move on, but documentation can protect you later.\r\n\r\n- Try to keep a simple written log, photos, and screenshots in a safe place. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n- Ask medical providers to record that injuries are related to domestic violence. [selfhelp.courts.ca](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/DV-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n### Isolating completely\r\n\r\nYou might feel ashamed or afraid of burdening others.\r\n\r\n- Reach out to at least one safe person or a hotline; isolation can make you more vulnerable to going back or staying in danger. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)\r\n\r\n### Not updating address with key agencies (safely)\r\n\r\nIf you move:\r\n\r\n- Update your address with the court (for your case), legal aid, benefits offices, and schools so you don’t miss notices—but ask about confidential addresses where possible. [sos.ca](https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home)\r\n- Consider Safe at Home if you’re moving and want more address privacy. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSuUcF98Us)\r\n\r\n### Missing court deadlines\r\n\r\nCourt paperwork and hearings can feel overwhelming.\r\n\r\n- Put all deadlines in one place (calendar, phone reminders, notebook).  \r\n- Ask legal aid, DV legal advocates, or court self‑help centers to help track your case. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\nIf you miss a hearing, contact the court or a legal aid office as soon as you can; sometimes there are ways to fix or reschedule.

You can enter at any step and move at your own pace.\r\n\r\n### 1. Ensure immediate safety\r\n\r\n- If you are in immediate danger, call **911**.  \r\n- If possible, move to a safer room or leave the location.  \r\n- Call the **National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1‑800‑799‑7233** or a local DV hotline for safety planning.

[nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)\r\n\r\n### 4. Secure temporary housing\r\n\r\n- Work with your advocate to access **emergency shelter** (DV shelter or motel vouchers), transitional housing, or staying safely with trusted people. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)\r\n- Ask about CalWORKs Homeless Assistance if you have children and low income. [calmatters.digitaldemocracy](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201720180ab557)\r\n\r\n### 5. File legal protections if needed\r\n\r\n- Consider a **Domestic Violence Restraining Order** through the California Courts self‑help center and local legal aid. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org)\r\n- Ask a DV legal advocate or legal aid attorney for help with DVROs, custody, divorce, immigration relief, or tenant protections. [lawhelpca](https://www.lawhelpca.org/resource/how-to-get-a-restraining-order)\r\n\r\n### 6. Access benefits and housing support\r\n\r\n- Apply for CalWORKs, CalFresh, Medi‑Cal, and other county benefits as needed; ask specifically for DV‑related accommodations or waivers. [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/jobs/gain/sss/domestic-violence.html)\r\n- Ask your DV case manager about transitional housing, rapid rehousing, and housing vouchers with DV preferences. [211bayarea](https://211bayarea.org/topics/housing-homeless-services/)\r\n\r\n### 7. Begin trauma recovery\r\n\r\n- Connect with counseling and support groups through DV agencies, community mental health, or your insurance. [cpedv](https://www.cpedv.org)\r\n- Learn about trauma responses and practice self‑care that feels realistic (sleep, food, gentle movement, time in safe spaces). [nsvrc](https://www.nsvrc.org/organizations/california-partnership-end-domestic-violence/)\r\n\r\n### 8. Rebuild income and stability\r\n\r\n- Explore job training, education, and employment supports (sometimes available through DV agencies and CalWORKs). [dpss.lacounty](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/cash/calworks/homeless/homeless-programs-services.html)\r\n- Use employment protections if you need time off or safety accommodations at work because of domestic violence. [spencerfane](https://www.spencerfane.com/insight/golden-state-gotchas-your-2026-california-employment-law-guide/)\r\n- Work with advocates on long‑term housing and financial goals, including budgeting and credit repair.

[courseforanger](https://courseforanger.com/states/CA)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 1: What Is Anger Management?\r\n\r\nAnger management is a structured, skills-based approach to understanding your anger, identifying triggers, and replacing impulsive reactions with safer, more effective responses. It is usually delivered as a class or group, not just unstructured talking, and focuses on practical tools like breathing, time-outs, communication skills, and problem-solving. [canr.msu](https://www.canr.msu.edu/alternatives_to_anger)\r\n\r\nThe main goals of anger management are to:  \r\n- Reduce how often and how intensely you feel anger.  \r\n- Help you pause before acting, so you avoid violence, threats, or destructive behavior.  \r\n- Improve communication, relationships, and decision-making under stress. [dbtcentersouthbay](https://www.dbtcentersouthbay.com/dbt-skills-for-managing-anger/)\r\n\r\nAnger management classes are different from individual therapy. Therapy usually focuses more deeply on trauma, depression, and long-term emotional patterns, while anger classes are often shorter, more educational, with a fixed curriculum and clear completion requirements (for example, 10–52 sessions). Many people take anger management for personal growth (to improve relationships, parenting, or work behavior), while others do it because a court, probation officer, CPS, or employer ordered it as a condition of probation, diversion, custody, or keeping a job.

Family courts also use anger management in custody, visitation, and CPS cases where there are concerns about parenting under stress, verbal abuse, or intimidating behavior. [copefamilysupport](https://copefamilysupport.org/anger-management-classes/)\r\n\r\nYour court order usually specifies:  \r\n- The number of hours or weeks (e.g., “12-week anger management” or “52-week BTP/anger management”). [ajnovickgroup](https://www.ajnovickgroup.com/anger-management/weekly-classes.aspx)\r\n- Whether the program must be “court-approved,” “probation-approved,” or on a specific county list. [thecaamp](https://www.thecaamp.com/pdf/Los%20Angeles%20County%20Probation%20Anger%20Management%20Providers_20230724_0001%20(1).pdf)\r\n- Any format restrictions (for example, “in-person group,” or “no online-only classes”). [namass](https://www.namass.org)\r\n\r\nTo confirm which providers the court accepts, you can:  \r\n- Ask the clerk, your attorney, or probation officer if there is an approved provider list.  \r\n- Use official county or court referral lists (many are PDFs on court or probation websites). [file.lacounty](https://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/probation/1186203_BIPlistJune2025.pdf)\r\n- Call the program and ask, “Do you have clients from [X Superior Court] or [X County Probation]? Are you on their approved list?” [ajnovickgroup](https://www.ajnovickgroup.com/anger-management/weekly-classes.aspx)\r\n\r\nFor documentation, courts typically want:  \r\n- Proof of enrollment.  \r\n- Regular attendance logs or progress reports (especially for longer programs).  \r\n- A final certificate with your full name, dates, hours or sessions completed, program name and address, and a signature/license or credential of the facilitator.

A few key dimensions matter.\r\n\r\n### Accreditation and licensing\r\n\r\nFor court cases, look for:  \r\n- Licensed mental health providers (LCSW, LMFT, LPCC, psychologist) or certified anger management specialists.  \r\n- Programs recognized by local courts, probation, or professional bodies like the National Anger Management Association (NAMA). [namass](https://www.namass.org)\r\n\r\nSome counties publish standards for anger programs (e.g., Sacramento’s Family Court requires specific core topics and minimum facilitator training). [saccourt.ca](https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/family/docs/fl-dv-anger-management-list.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Court-required list or open choice\r\n\r\nIn some counties, you must pick a provider from a court or probation list (for example, LA County Probation anger management provider PDF). Other courts allow any “qualified” provider, but you still carry the risk that an unknown online-only website may not be accepted. Always check before you pay. [courseforanger](https://courseforanger.com/states/CA)\r\n\r\n### Individual vs. group\r\n\r\n- Group classes: Usually weekly, more affordable, and common for court orders (e.g., 10–52 weeks). [apathforchange](https://www.apathforchange.org)\r\n- Individual sessions: More flexible and private, often higher cost per hour, sometimes used to meet work requirements or when groups are not available. [whatsgoodaboutanger](http://www.whatsgoodaboutanger.com)\r\n\r\n### Online vs. in-person\r\n\r\n- Fully online, self-paced courses are widely marketed and often acceptable for some courts and employers, but many judges, probation departments, and NAMA caution against online-only self-paced classes without a live component for serious or DV-related cases. [aatpp](https://aatpp.com/course-anger-management.php)\r\n- Live online (Zoom/telehealth) groups can satisfy many court orders because they resemble in-person groups with attendance tracking. [angermanagementseminar](https://www.angermanagementseminar.com)\r\n- In-person classes are still preferred by many courts, especially for higher-risk cases. [copefamilysupport](https://copefamilysupport.org/anger-management-classes/)\r\n\r\n### Cost, insurance, and sliding scale\r\n\r\nTypical ranges:  \r\n- Community or court-referred group: about 20–35 USD per session, plus a one-time enrollment fee. [bisclasses](https://www.bisclasses.com/angermanagementprogram.html)\r\n- Private practice therapist: 125–250 USD per session, sometimes billable to insurance if coded as therapy. [psychologytoday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/groups/california?category=anger-management)\r\n- Online self-paced courses: often 25–100 USD total, depending on hours. [americanhealthtraining](https://www.americanhealthtraining.com/online-anger-management-class/)\r\n\r\nSome nonprofits and county programs offer sliding scale or low-cost options; they may ask for proof of income to set your fee. County mental health systems sometimes provide anger groups as part of broader services, especially for Medi-Cal or low-income clients. [dmh.lacounty](https://dmh.lacounty.gov/get-help-now/)\r\n\r\n### Language access and trauma-informed care\r\n\r\nIf English is not your first language, look for classes in Spanish or other languages or bilingual facilitators (county lists often show languages). Trauma-informed providers recognize that past abuse, violence, or war can shape how anger shows up and focus on safety, shame reduction, and regulation rather than just punishment. [lavidacounselingcenter](https://www.lavidacounselingcenter.com/anger-management.html)\r\n\r\n### Questions to ask before you sign up\r\n\r\nYou can use these sample questions when you call or email:  \r\n- “Is your program on the approved list for [X County] Court or Probation?”  \r\n- “How many weeks or hours is the program, and how often do classes meet?”  \r\n- “Do you provide a certificate of completion that lists my hours, dates, and case number if needed?”  \r\n- “What is the cost per session, are there any enrollment or workbook fees, and do you offer sliding scale?”  \r\n- “Is this group in-person, live online, or self-paced online? Will my court accept this format?”  \r\n- “Do you work with people who have domestic violence–related charges or child welfare cases?”  \r\n\r\nHelpful references:  \r\n- NAMA’s note on court-ordered online programs: https://www.namass.org [namass](https://www.namass.org)\r\n- Behavioral Intervention Services Anger Management Program (pricing example): https://www.bisclasses.com/angermanagementprogram.html [bisclasses](https://www.bisclasses.com/angermanagementprogram.html)\r\n- Course For Anger (national online cost breakdown): https://courseforanger.com/states/CA [courseforanger](https://courseforanger.com/states/CA)\r\n- A Path for Change (BTP/anger management with sliding fees): https://www.apathforchange.org [apathforchange](https://www.apathforchange.org)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 4: General National Resources\r\n\r\nThese resources are not California-specific and can be used across the U.S. Always confirm that a given option is acceptable in your court.\r\n\r\n### Telamon Corporation Anger-Related Services\r\n\r\nTelamon Corporation operates in 11 states and offers early childhood, family support, workforce, and housing programs, with mental health consultation and parenting/behavior support in some regions.

It is not a classic court-ordered anger management provider but is useful for teachers or school staff needing structured stress and emotion regulation support.

[canr.msu](https://www.canr.msu.edu/alternatives_to_anger)\r\n- Identifying triggers (situations, people, thoughts) and early warning signs.  \r\n- Cognitive-behavioral skills: catching “hot thoughts,” challenging distorted beliefs, and replacing them with more balanced thinking. [angermanagementasb](https://www.angermanagementasb.com/post/what-to-expect-in-court-ordered-anger-management-classes-a-comprehensive-guide)\r\n- DBT-informed skills such as mindfulness, distress tolerance, and emotion regulation for intense feelings. [psychologytoday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/groups/ca/los-angeles?category=anger-management)\r\n- Communication skills: assertiveness, boundary-setting, listening, and conflict de-escalation. [schroedercounseling](https://www.schroedercounseling.com/court-approved-anger-management-classes)\r\n\r\nAttendance requirements:  \r\n- Court programs frequently run for 10–52 sessions, once per week; missing classes can delay completion and may be reported to the court. [apathforchange](https://www.apathforchange.org)\r\n- Programs may require you to arrive on time, sign in, and complete homework to get credit. [schroedercounseling](https://www.schroedercounseling.com/court-approved-anger-management-classes)\r\n\r\nHomework can include:  \r\n- Tracking anger episodes and triggers.  \r\n- Practicing coping skills (time-outs, breathing, replacement thoughts).  \r\n- Applying new communication strategies at home or work and reporting back. [angermanagementasb](https://www.angermanagementasb.com/post/what-to-expect-in-court-ordered-anger-management-classes-a-comprehensive-guide)\r\n\r\nCertificates and documentation:  \r\n- At the end, you receive a certificate listing your name, course dates, number of hours/weeks completed, and provider credentials or license. [schroedercounseling](https://www.schroedercounseling.com/court-approved-anger-management-classes)\r\n- Some providers send progress or completion reports directly to your attorney, probation, or CPS worker, if you request it.

[apathforchange](https://www.apathforchange.org)\r\n- Keep a personal folder with all receipts, attendance slips, progress letters, and your final certificate. [schroedercounseling](https://www.schroedercounseling.com/court-approved-anger-management-classes)\r\n- If you must miss a class, talk to the provider ahead of time; some allow make-up sessions and can document excused absences. [bisclasses](https://www.bisclasses.com/angermanagementprogram.html)\r\n\r\nCourts usually want to see on your certificate:  \r\n- Your full legal name and (often) your date of birth or case number.  \r\n- Total hours or number of sessions completed and the date range.  \r\n- Program name, address, and phone number.  \r\n- Signature and credential/license of the facilitator. [saccourt.ca](https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/family/docs/fl-dv-anger-management-list.pdf)\r\n\r\nTo avoid non-compliance:  \r\n- Never assume any random website will be accepted; confirm first with court/probation.  \r\n- Start early; a 26- or 52-week class takes many months to complete. [apathforchange](https://www.apathforchange.org)\r\n- If your case is in a different state than your residence, confirm whether out-of-state or online programs are accepted. [angermasters](https://angermasters.com/court)\r\n\r\nKey references:  \r\n- Sacramento anger program requirements (what must be documented): https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/family/docs/fl-dv-anger-management-list.pdf [saccourt.ca](https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/family/docs/fl-dv-anger-management-list.pdf)\r\n- Schroeder Counseling – completion certificates: https://www.schroedercounseling.com/court-approved-anger-management-classes [schroedercounseling](https://www.schroedercounseling.com/court-approved-anger-management-classes)\r\n- Course For Anger – sample certificate: https://courseforanger.com/states/CA [courseforanger](https://courseforanger.com/states/CA)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Section 10: Common Mistakes & Recommendations\r\n\r\nFrequent mistakes include:\r\n\r\n- Picking the cheapest online class without checking court acceptance; some certificates are rejected, forcing you to start over. [namass](https://www.namass.org)\r\n- Ignoring format requirements (e.g., doing a self-paced online class when the order requires “in-person group” or “live online”). [namass](https://www.namass.org)\r\n- Not checking for accreditation/licensing or court approval; some providers are legitimate for self-help but not set up for court documentation. [saccourt.ca](https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/family/docs/fl-dv-anger-management-list.pdf)\r\n- Assuming all anger management is the same; domestic violence–related cases often require specialized batterer intervention programs, not just generic anger classes. [file.lacounty](https://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/probation/1186203_BIPlistJune2025.pdf)\r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\r\n- If your case is in California, start by asking your attorney or probation officer if there’s a list (LA, Sacramento, and many Bay Area counties publish standards or provider lists). [copefamilysupport](https://copefamilysupport.org/anger-management-classes/)\r\n- For personal growth, you have more flexibility—consider DBT skills groups, RELAX classes, or private therapy focusing on anger.

[ajnovickgroup](https://www.ajnovickgroup.com/anger-management/weekly-classes.aspx)\r\n2. **Confirm whether your court or probation uses an approved provider list.** Ask your attorney, probation officer, or the court clerk, and look for PDFs on the court or probation website (for example, LA Probation list or Sacramento Family Court list). [saccourt.ca](https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/family/docs/fl-dv-anger-management-list.pdf)\r\n3. **Identify several potential providers.** Use county lists, COPE or other nonprofit sites, and directories like Psychology Today’s anger management filter for your city or county. [psychologytoday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/groups/california?category=anger-management)\r\n4. **Call or email and ask key questions.** Confirm court acceptance, cost and payment policies, language options, schedule, live vs. self-paced format, and what type of documentation they provide. [ajnovickgroup](https://www.ajnovickgroup.com/anger-management/weekly-classes.aspx)\r\n5. **Enroll and confirm start date and plan.** Make sure your timeline fits your court deadlines; if you have a 26- or 52-week requirement, starting early is critical. [apathforchange](https://www.apathforchange.org)\r\n6. **Keep all receipts and certificates together.** Maintain a folder with proof of enrollment, progress reports, and your final certificate so you can quickly provide them to court, probation, CPS, or your lawyer.

[cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/pages/vital-records.aspx)\r\n\r\n### Recommended order (for most adults in California and nationwide)\r\n\r\n1. Birth certificate  \r\n2. Social Security card  \r\n3. State ID / driver’s license (ideally a Real ID)  \r\n4. Marriage certificate and/or divorce certificate  \r\n5. GED or high school diploma  \r\n6.

Military discharge papers (DD‑214), professional licenses, and immigration documents  \r\n\r\n**Why this order matters**\r\n\r\n- Birth certificate is your **core** identity and citizenship document; almost every other agency accepts it as primary proof of identity or U.S. birth. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/VS111.pdf)\r\n- Social Security card connects your legal name and SSN, which is needed for work, taxes, and many ID applications. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n- State ID/driver’s license is the main photo ID used for nearly everything in daily life and is required for many in‑person applications. [dmv.ca](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/)\r\n- Marriage/divorce certificates prove name changes and marital status, which you may need to update SSA, DMV, or a passport. [lavote](https://www.lavote.gov)\r\n- Education documents and DD‑214 are usually needed for jobs, licensing, or benefits but generally require basic ID first. [archives](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records)\r\n\r\nIf you are unhoused or low‑income in California, you may be able to get a free California birth certificate and free California photo ID if a homeless service provider completes the required fee‑waiver forms with you.

[cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/pages/vital-records.aspx)\r\nAgencies use certified copies (not photocopies) to prove identity, age, and citizenship for Social Security, passports, Real ID, school, and benefits. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/VS111.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Finding the right office (nationwide)\r\n\r\n- If born in the U.S.:  \r\n  - Your record is held by the **state vital records office** (usually “Department of Health” or “Vital Records”) and often also by the **county** where you were born. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/pages/vital-records.aspx)\r\n  - To find your state office:  \r\n    - Go to your state’s official .gov site (for example, search: “[Your State] vital records birth certificate”).  \r\n- If born in California:  \r\n  - State level: **California Department of Public Health – Vital Records (CDPH‑VR)**. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/pages/vital-records.aspx)\r\n  - County level: County **Registrar/Recorder** or **Clerk** where you were born (e.g., Los Angeles County Registrar‑Recorder).

Ordering through your county (often faster)**\r\n\r\nLos Angeles County  \r\n- Vital records information: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dca/dcabirth.htm [publichealth.lacounty](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dca/dcabirth.htm)\r\n- County Registrar‑Recorder site: https://www.lavote.gov [locator.lacounty](https://locator.lacounty.gov/lac/Location/3175505/los-angeles-county-registrar-recordercounty-clerk---beverly-hills)\r\n- Fees: LA County notes that, effective Jan 1, 2026, fees for certified birth records increased pursuant to AB 64; check the site for the current amount (recent notices put it around 34 USD). [lavote](https://www.lavote.gov)\r\n- You can request in person at Registrar‑Recorder offices (Norwalk main office or district locations) or by mail/online via VitalChek. [locator.lacounty](https://locator.lacounty.gov/lac/Location/3175505/los-angeles-county-registrar-recordercounty-clerk---beverly-hills)\r\n\r\nOrange County  \r\n- Look up “Orange County CA birth certificate” and go to the official ocgov.com / ochealthinfo.com vital records page; they provide in‑person, mail, and online (often via VitalChek) ordering. [vitalchek](https://www.vitalchek.com/v/birth-certificates/california/california-vital-statistics)\r\n\r\nSan Diego County  \r\n- Search “San Diego County birth certificate” and go to the official sandiegocounty.gov Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk vital records page. They offer in‑person and mail orders, plus online ordering through approved vendors. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/pages/vital-records.aspx)\r\n\r\n### What information and ID you usually need\r\n\r\nTypical birth certificate application asks for: [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/VS111.pdf)\r\n\r\n- Full name at birth  \r\n- Date of birth (or approximate)  \r\n- City and county of birth  \r\n- Parent names (including parent last name before marriage)  \r\n- Your relationship to the person whose record you’re ordering  \r\n- Reason for the request  \r\n\r\nFor a certified copy (authorized):  \r\n- Notarized sworn statement that you are an authorized person (self, parent, child, legal representative, etc.). [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/VS111.pdf)\r\n- A copy of a valid government photo ID if ordering through some counties or vendors. [vitalchek](https://www.vitalchek.com/v/marriage-records/california/los-angeles-county-registrar-recorder)\r\n\r\n### What if you have no ID in California?\r\n\r\nCalifornia law allows eligible people experiencing homelessness to get **fee‑exempt** copies of their California birth certificate if they provide an affidavit from a homeless services provider. [ccr.saccounty](https://ccr.saccounty.gov/content/ccr/us/en/no-fee-birth-certificate-for-homeless-persons.html)\r\n\r\nBasic steps (California, including LA/OC/SD):  \r\n1. Contact a homeless service provider, emergency shelter, or county human services office and say you need a **birth certificate fee waiver** (often based on AB 1733 and Health & Safety Code 103577). [housingca](https://housingca.org/resources/community/providers/help-someone-get-ca-birthcert/)\r\n2. The provider completes and signs an “Affidavit of Homeless Status” and any county form required. [ccr.saccounty](https://ccr.saccounty.gov/content/ccr/us/en/no-fee-birth-certificate-for-homeless-persons.html)\r\n3. Bring that affidavit/form to the County Recorder/Registrar office where you were born to get a **no‑fee certified copy**. [housingca](https://housingca.org/resources/community/providers/help-someone-get-ca-birthcert/)\r\n\r\nThis fee waiver also connects with free California ID cards for unhoused people (see Section 4).

[ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\nYou can usually request a replacement online, by starting an application online, or by completing Form SS‑5 and visiting or mailing documents to a local SSA office. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)\r\n\r\nOfficial SSA links:  \r\n- Replacement card info: https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\n- Online account (“my Social Security”): https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n- Application for a Social Security Card (Form SS‑5, PDF): https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Online replacement (many Californians)\r\n\r\nYou may be able to replace your card entirely online if: [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n\r\n- You are a U.S. citizen age 18 or older.  \r\n- You have a driver’s license or state ID from a participating state (California participates). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n- You have a U.S. mailing address.  \r\n- You do not need to change your name, date/place of birth, or gender. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n\r\nSteps:  \r\n1. Create/sign into your **my Social Security** account at https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n2. Select “Replace your Social Security card” and confirm eligibility questions. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n3. Enter your identity details (name, SSN, DOB, driver’s license/ID info, address, phone). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n4. Submit your request; SSA mails the new card, usually within 10–14 business days. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Start online, finish at a local office\r\n\r\nIf you cannot fully complete your request online, SSA allows you to: [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n\r\n- Answer screening questions on the SSN web page.  \r\n- Begin your application online and self‑schedule an appointment at a local SSA office. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n- Bring required original documents in person to finish.  \r\n\r\n### Option 3: Paper Form SS‑5 (mail or in person)\r\n\r\nUse this if you:  \r\n- Have never had a SSN,  \r\n- Need to correct data, or  \r\n- Cannot use the online tools.  \r\n\r\nSteps:  \r\n1. Download and fill out Form SS‑5: https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)\r\n2. Gather **original** documents proving identity (and citizenship/immigration status, if needed). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\n3. Mail or take the form and documents to your local SSA office; find locations at https://www.ssa.gov/locator.

[ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\n\r\nThere is **no fee** for a replacement Social Security card. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n\r\n### What if you have no ID yet?\r\n\r\nBecause SSA generally requires valid ID, many people should first secure a birth certificate and then a state ID. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\nIf you lack ID, you can:  \r\n\r\n- Ask SSA which alternate documents they will accept in your situation (for example, school, medical, or employment records). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\n- Use your birth certificate plus another secondary document (like health insurance card) if accepted.

[dmv.ca](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/)\r\n\r\nKey California DMV link:  \r\n- Replace your DL/ID: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/ [dmv.ca](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/)\r\n\r\n### Replacing a lost California DL or ID\r\n\r\nFor most Californians, you can request a replacement (duplicate) if your card is lost, stolen, or damaged. [dmv.ca](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/)\r\n\r\n**Online replacement (driver’s license only)**  \r\n1.

[ged](https://www.ged.com/blog/how-to-obtain-a-copy-of-your-ged-transcript.html)\r\n\r\nNational GED portal:  \r\n- https://www.GED.com [ged](https://www.ged.com/life-after-ged.html)\r\n\r\nIf you earned a GED:  \r\n- Many states (including California) use GED.com for registrations, testing, and transcript requests. [ged](https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html)\r\n\r\nCalifornia GED transcript link:  \r\n- https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html [ged](https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html)\r\n\r\nTypical steps (California / most GED.com states):  \r\n1. Go to the state‑specific transcript page (example for CA above). [ged](https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html)\r\n2. Sign in to your GED.com account, or create one using your testing information. [ged](https://www.ged.com/blog/how-to-obtain-a-copy-of-your-ged-transcript.html)\r\n3. Order official transcripts or a diploma replacement; choose mail or electronic delivery. [study](https://study.com/academy/popular/how-to-get-a-new-ged-certificate.html)\r\n4. Pay the fee (commonly around 15–20 USD per transcript/diploma; confirm on site). [study](https://study.com/academy/popular/how-to-get-a-new-ged-certificate.html)\r\n5. Electronic copies may arrive same day; printed diplomas may take up to 2–3 weeks. [study](https://study.com/academy/popular/how-to-get-a-new-ged-certificate.html)\r\n\r\nIf you don’t remember how you tested or where:  \r\n- The GED.com help article recommends contacting your **state Department of Education** if you cannot locate your record through GED.com. [ged](https://www.ged.com/blog/how-to-obtain-a-copy-of-your-ged-transcript.html)\r\n\r\n### High school diplomas and transcripts\r\n\r\nFor traditional high school diplomas:  \r\n- Contact the high school directly (registrar or counseling office) and ask how to request a transcript or diploma reprint.  \r\n- If the school closed, contact the **school district** or **state Department of Education** to see who holds archived records. [ged](https://www.ged.com/blog/how-to-obtain-a-copy-of-your-ged-transcript.html)\r\n\r\nInformation you usually need:  \r\n- Full name at time of attendance  \r\n- Date of birth  \r\n- Approximate years attended and graduation year  \r\n- School name and city  \r\n- Photo ID (state ID, license, or birth certificate)  \r\n\r\nKey links for this section:  \r\n- GED main site: https://www.ged.com [ged](https://www.ged.com/life-after-ged.html)\r\n- California GED transcripts: https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html [ged](https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSECTION 7: COLLEGE DEGREES & TRANSCRIPTS  \r\n\r\nCollege diplomas and transcripts are issued by your specific college or university, not by a central government office.  \r\n\r\n### How to request college transcripts\r\n\r\n1. Find your school registrar’s page by searching “[College/University name] registrar transcripts.”  \r\n2. Most registrars use systems like **Parchment**, **National Student Clearinghouse**, or internal portals. [study](https://study.com/academy/popular/how-to-get-a-new-ged-certificate.html)\r\n3. Create an account or log in and submit a request, including:  \r\n   - Your name (include former names),  \r\n   - Student ID or SSN (if requested),  \r\n   - Dates of attendance,  \r\n   - Destination (your address, employer, another school).  \r\n4. Pay transcript fee (often 5–15 USD per copy, plus mailing or electronic delivery fees). [study](https://study.com/academy/popular/how-to-get-a-new-ged-certificate.html)\r\n\r\n### Replacing a college diploma\r\n\r\nMost colleges allow you to order a replacement diploma:  \r\n- Check the registrar’s or alumni page for “replacement diploma.”  \r\n- Fees may range from about 25–75 USD, plus shipping.  \r\n\r\n### If the school closed\r\n\r\nIf a college closed:  \r\n- Check your state’s Department of Education or licensing agency for “closed school records.”  \r\n- Many closed schools have their student records transferred to a designated custodian or state archive.  \r\n\r\nBecause this process is school‑specific, always confirm instructions on the official college or state education website.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSECTION 8: OPTIONAL DOCUMENTS (DD‑214, PROFESSIONAL LICENSES, TRIBAL & IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS)  \r\n\r\n### Military discharge papers (DD‑214)\r\n\r\nThe DD‑214 is your official military discharge document; it is critical for VA benefits, job applications, and some licenses. [dd214](https://www.dd214.com/dd214_faq)\r\n\r\nPrimary sources:  \r\n- National Archives – Military Service Records (NPRC): https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records [archives](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records)\r\n- eVetRecs online request system: https://vetrecs.archives.gov/s/ [vetrecs.archives](https://vetrecs.archives.gov/s/)\r\n- VA DD‑214 info page: https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/ [va](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/)\r\n\r\nKey points:  \r\n- Veterans and next‑of‑kin can request DD‑214s at **no cost** in most cases. [dd214](https://www.dd214.com/dd214_faq)\r\n- You can request records online using eVetRecs, then print, sign, and mail or fax a signature page, or use Standard Form SF‑180 by mail. [blog.dd214direct](https://blog.dd214direct.com/i-need-a-copy-of-my-dd214-what-do-i-do-now)\r\n\r\nBasic steps via eVetRecs:  \r\n1. Go to https://vetrecs.archives.gov/s/ and select “Make a new request.” [vetrecs.archives](https://vetrecs.archives.gov/s/)\r\n2. Answer the online questions about your branch, dates of service, and reason for request. [archives](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records)\r\n3. Print, sign, and date the signature page, then mail or fax it to the address given, or follow the online authentication instructions. [blog.dd214direct](https://blog.dd214direct.com/i-need-a-copy-of-my-dd214-what-do-i-do-now)\r\n4. Wait for mailed copies; processing time depends on backlog, but emergency options exist (for example, for burial or urgent medical needs). [va](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/)\r\n\r\n### Professional licenses (California example: nurses, contractors, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Each profession has its own licensing board (e.g., California Board of Registered Nursing, Contractors State License Board).  \r\n- To replace a license card or print verification, go to the board’s official website (always .gov or .ca.gov) and look for “duplicate license” or “license verification.”  \r\n\r\nYou will usually need:  \r\n- License number or personal info,  \r\n- Proof of identity,  \r\n- A fee (commonly 10–30 USD).  \r\n\r\n### Tribal ID\r\n\r\n- Tribal identification cards are issued by your federally recognized tribe.  \r\n- Contact your tribe’s enrollment or membership office for replacement procedures and fees.  \r\n- Some tribes require you to submit a copy of a state ID or birth certificate plus an application and fee.  \r\n\r\n### Immigration documents (USCIS)\r\n\r\nCommon replacement forms:  \r\n- **Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)** – Form I‑90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card.  \r\n- **Employment Authorization Document (EAD/work permit)** – Form I‑765, Application for Employment Authorization (replacement option for lost/stolen). [citizenpath](https://citizenpath.com/form-i-765-guide/lost-ead-replacement/)\r\n\r\nKey links:  \r\n- USCIS forms: https://www.uscis.gov/forms [citizenpath](https://citizenpath.com/form-i-765-guide/lost-ead-replacement/)\r\n- I‑90 info and filing: https://www.uscis.gov/i-90 [citizenpath](https://citizenpath.com/form-i-765-guide/lost-ead-replacement/)\r\n- I‑765 info: https://www.uscis.gov/i-765 [manifestlaw](https://manifestlaw.com/blog/form-i-765/)\r\n\r\nTypical process:  \r\n1. Create a USCIS online account (optional but strongly recommended).  \r\n2. Select and complete the appropriate form, choosing “replacement” if the card was lost, stolen, or destroyed. [citizenpath](https://citizenpath.com/form-i-765-guide/lost-ead-replacement/)\r\n3. Upload supporting documents (proof of identity, immigration status) and pay filing fees unless eligible for a fee waiver (Form I‑912). [citizenpath](https://citizenpath.com/form-i-765-guide/lost-ead-replacement/)\r\n4. USCIS sends a receipt; processing can take several months, depending on the form and category. [manifestlaw](https://manifestlaw.com/blog/form-i-765/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSECTION 9: FREE OR LOW-COST HELP  \r\n\r\n### Fee waivers and free copies\r\n\r\n- **SSA**: Replacement Social Security cards are always free. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-02017.html)\r\n- **California birth certificates for unhoused people**: Fee‑exempt for eligible homeless persons with an affidavit from a homeless service provider. [ccr.saccounty](https://ccr.saccounty.gov/content/ccr/us/en/no-fee-birth-certificate-for-homeless-persons.html)\r\n- **California ID cards for unhoused people**: No‑fee ID cards with completed DL 933 verification form from a homeless service provider. [file.lacounty](http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dmh/1062827_4e0dfda1-41dc-4303-a03c-e1cbdc606ebb.pdf)\r\n- Some vital records offices offer reduced or waived fees after disasters or for low‑income individuals; check your state/county website, especially in fire or flood recovery pages (California example: “Marriage certificates 2025 Los Angeles Fires”). [ca](https://www.ca.gov/lafires/help-for-you/replace-personal-documents/marriage-certificates/)\r\n\r\n### Legal aid and ID recovery support (California focus)\r\n\r\n- Call **211** from any phone in California to reach local referrals for shelters, legal aid, and ID recovery help.  \r\n- Many legal aid groups assist with name changes, immigration document issues, and identity theft.  \r\n\r\nExamples (you can search by county):  \r\n- Search “Los Angeles legal aid ID replacement” or check LA County Legal Aid Foundation/Neighborhood Legal Services sites.  \r\n- Similar organizations exist in Orange and San Diego Counties.  \r\n\r\n### Social services and case management\r\n\r\nPeople who are unhoused, at risk of homelessness, or survivors of disaster can often get help through:  \r\n- County departments of public social services  \r\n- Homeless outreach teams and coordinated entry systems  \r\n- Veterans Resource Centers and VA social workers (for veterans’ documents and DD‑214). [va](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/)\r\n\r\nThese providers can help:  \r\n- Complete homeless affidavits and DMV form DL 933. [housingca](https://housingca.org/resources/community/providers/help-someone-get-a-ca-photo-id/)\r\n- Navigate SSA, DHS, and DMV visits.  \r\n- Pay or waive fees when possible via emergency funds.\r\n\r\nKey low‑cost help links:  \r\n- Housing California birth certificate/ID guides: https://housingca.org/resources/community/individuals/get-ca-birthcert/ and https://housingca.org/resources/community/individuals/get-my-ca-photo-id/ [housingca](https://housingca.org/resources/community/individuals/get-my-ca-photo-id/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSECTION 10: COMMON PROBLEMS & WORKAROUNDS  \r\n\r\n### 1. No ID at all\r\n\r\nIf you truly have zero photo ID, start with:  \r\n\r\n1. **Birth certificate** – use homeless fee‑waiver in CA if eligible. [ccr.saccounty](https://ccr.saccounty.gov/content/ccr/us/en/no-fee-birth-certificate-for-homeless-persons.html)\r\n2. Use birth certificate to help get Social Security card (SSA will accept it plus possibly other non‑photo records). [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)\r\n3. Use birth certificate + SSN proof + homeless verification (if applicable) to get free CA ID card. [file.lacounty](http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dmh/1062827_4e0dfda1-41dc-4303-a03c-e1cbdc606ebb.pdf)\r\n\r\nService providers (shelters, outreach workers) can be crucial in verifying identity and homelessness status. [housingca](https://housingca.org/resources/community/individuals/get-ca-birthcert/)\r\n\r\n### 2. Name discrepancies and name changes\r\n\r\n- If your name changed due to marriage, divorce, or court order, you will often need a **marriage certificate**, **divorce decree**, or **court order** to update SSA, DMV, and other records. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/PSB/Pages/BirthDeathMarriageCertificates.aspx)\r\n- SSA lets you correct or update your name and other details when applying for a replacement card; you will need proof of the legal name change. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\n- If your birth certificate, SSA record, and ID show different names, start by correcting SSA and then updating DMV to match. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm)\r\n\r\n### 3. Missing or unknown parental information\r\n\r\nBirth certificate applications may ask for parent names; if you are unsure: [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/VS111.pdf)\r\n\r\n- Provide as much as you know (approximate spelling, partial names). [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/VS111.pdf)\r\n- If the record cannot be found, CDPH may issue a **Certificate of No Public Record**, and you may need to contact the county where you think you were born for help with a manual search. [housingca](https://housingca.org/resources/community/providers/help-someone-get-ca-birthcert/)\r\n\r\n### 4. Destroyed records (fires, floods, older military service)\r\n\r\n- California has special information pages for replacing personal documents after disasters such as wildfires (example: marriage certificates for LA fires). [ca](https://www.ca.gov/lafires/help-for-you/replace-personal-documents/marriage-certificates/)\r\n- For military records damaged or destroyed (e.g., 1973 NPRC fire), NPRC can sometimes reconstruct records from alternative sources. [usamm](https://www.usamm.com/blogs/news/how-to-get-a-dd214-for-deceased-relative)\r\n\r\n### 5. Immigration and deportation status complications\r\n\r\n- If you are a non‑citizen and lost your immigration documents (green card, EAD, I‑94), contact USCIS and, if possible, a legal aid/immigration attorney.  \r\n- Use Form I‑90 for green cards and Form I‑765 for EADs; check Form I‑912 for possible fee waivers if you cannot afford filing fees. [manifestlaw](https://manifestlaw.com/blog/form-i-765/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSECTION 11: CHECKLISTS & SAMPLE LANGUAGE  \r\n\r\n### Quick checklists (California‑oriented)\r\n\r\n**Birth certificate (California):**  \r\n- Completed VS 111 form.

[vetrecs.archives](https://vetrecs.archives.gov/s/)\r\n\r\n### Sample phone scripts\r\n\r\nWhen calling a county vital records office (example for LA County birth certificate):  \r\n\r\n> “Hello, my name is [Name]. I was born in [Year] in Los Angeles County, and I need a certified copy of my birth certificate. I’m calling to ask: What is the current fee, what forms do I need, and can I apply by mail or in person? I am also [experiencing homelessness / low‑income] and want to ask if there is a fee waiver available for my situation.”\r\n\r\nWhen calling SSA for ID issues:  \r\n\r\n> “Hi, I lost my Social Security card and I don’t have a current driver’s license or state ID. I do have [birth certificate/other documents]. What documents will you accept to prove my identity, and how should I submit them to apply for a replacement card?”\r\n\r\nWhen contacting a GED or high school registrar:  \r\n\r\n> “Hello, my name is [Name]. I completed my [GED / high school diploma] at [School or program name] around [Year]. I lost my original diploma and transcripts. Can you tell me how to request an official transcript or a replacement diploma, what the fee is, and what identification you require?”\r\n\r\nWhen calling the National Archives for DD‑214 help:  \r\n\r\n> “Hello, I am a veteran and I need a copy of my DD‑214. I started a request online through eVetRecs but I don’t have a printer. Can you explain how I can submit the required signature and what my options are for getting my record as quickly as possible?”\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSECTION 12: TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS & FOLLOW‑UP  \r\n\r\nTypical timelines (these are general ranges; always check current estimates on each site):  \r\n\r\n- California birth certificate (state CDPH): Several weeks or longer by mail, depending on volume. [cdph.ca](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Obtaining-Certified-Copies-Online.aspx)\r\n- California birth certificate (county LA/OC/SD): Sometimes same day in person, or 1–3 weeks by mail. [publichealth.lacounty](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dca/dcabirth.htm)\r\n- SSA replacement card: Often 10–14 business days after SSA accepts your application. [ssa](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/assets/materials/EN-05-10288.pdf)\r\n- California DL/ID replacement: 3–4 weeks by mail; contact DMV if not received within 60 days. [dmv.ca](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/)\r\n- Marriage certificate (LA County via VitalChek): Processing plus mailing time (often 1–3 weeks, but can vary). [vitalchek](https://www.vitalchek.com/v/marriage-records/california/los-angeles-county-registrar-recorder)\r\n- GED/college transcripts: Electronic delivery often same day, paper copies 1–3 weeks plus mailing. [ged](https://www.ged.com/transcripts/california.html)\r\n- DD‑214: Timelines vary; routine requests can take weeks, but emergency requests (for burial or urgent needs) may be expedited. [va](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/)\r\n\r\nIf it takes longer than expected:  \r\n- Use tracking tools where available (e.g., eVetRecs status page, VitalChek order tracking, SSA online account). [vetrecs.archives](https://vetrecs.archives.gov/s/)\r\n- Call the issuing office with your order number or case number.  \r\n- For mail lost by USPS, some agencies require you to submit a new application and fee; CDPH, for example, is not responsible for lost mail and does not refund after an order is accepted.

  Adults who did not finish high school, need to improve English, or want to change careers.​\r\n\r\nMost programs have no tuition cost for URM guests; availability of specific courses can depend on staffing and partnerships.​\r\nAdult Basic Education & GED/HiSET Prep\r\n\r\nAdult Basic Education (ABE)\r\n\r\n    Focuses on reading, writing, and math at foundational levels.​\r\n\r\n    Helps

level.​\r\n\r\n    Gradual progression toward test readiness, followed by referral to official testing centers or partner schools.​\r\n\r\nESL and Computer Literacy\r\n\r\nEnglish as a Second Language

with S.E.S. and F.E.S. program expectations to save monthly and manage program fees.​\r\n\r\n    Topics may include opening accounts, avoiding predatory lending, and planning for rent and utilities.​\r\n\r\nVocational training and trade school connections\r\n\r\n    URM connects guests with trade schools and vocational programs (e.g., construction, culinary, caregiving, commercial driving) through partner organizations.​\r\n\r\n    Learning Center staff help with applications, placement tests, and financial aid forms when possible.​\r\n\r\n    Past partners have included LA Mission College, Five Keys Schools and Programs, and other workforce organizations.​\r\n\r\nCredit Recovery & Education Planning\r\n\r\nCredit recovery\r\n\r\n    For adults who were close to finishing high school, URM and partner schools can help identify missing credits and pathways to completion.​\r\n\r\n    In some cases, guests can enroll with charter or adult high school programs that specialize in credit recovery.​\r\n\r\nEducation planning\r\n\r\n    One-on-one support to map out education goals: GED, trade license, community college, or certification.​\r\n\r\n    Assistance with applications, transcripts, and referrals to programs that fit your pace and recovery stage.​\r\n\r\nHow Guests Enroll\r\n\r\nStep 1: Express interest\r\n\r\n    Talk to your case manager, program staff, or the Learning Center directly.​\r\n\r\n    If you are in Emmaus, Damascus Road, S.E.S., or F.E.S., education is often built into your case plan.​\r\n\r\nStep 2: Assessment\r\n\r\n    You may take placement tests (e.g., TABE) to determine reading and math levels.​\r\n\r\n    Staff discuss your goals and available time (considering work therapy, appointments, and childcare).​\r\n\r\nStep 3: Build a learning plan\r\n\r\n    Together you and the educator design a schedule: classes, tutoring, computer lab time, and homework expectations.​\r\n\r\n    Plans are flexible so they can be adjusted if your health or program schedule shifts.​\r\n\r\nStep 4: Start classes\r\n\r\n    You attend classes on-site in the Learning Center, often located within the URM building.​\r\n\r\n    You may also be connected to online or external classes through partner schools.​\r\n\r\nTypical Weekly Schedule\r\n\r\nWhile exact schedules vary, a realistic weekly pattern for a program participant might include:​\r\n\r\n    2–4 sessions per week of academic classes (ABE, GED/HiSET, or ESL).\r\n\r\n    1–2 sessions per week of computer lab focused on job readiness.\r\n\r\n    1 financial stewardship or life-skills workshop each week.\r\n\r\n    1–2 hours of individual tutoring or homework support.\r\n\r\n    Integration with work therapy, recovery groups, and appointments.\r\n\r\nGuests in full-time recovery programs may spend more time in classes, while those working or in S.E.S./F.E.S. may attend fewer but targeted sessions.​\r\nCertification Pathways & Realistic Outcomes\r\n\r\nPossible certifications\r\n\r\n    High school equivalency (GED/HiSET) certificate.​\r\n\r\n    Specialized vocational certificates from partner programs (e.g., ServSafe for food handling, basic computer certificates, industry-specific trainings).​\r\n\r\n    Documented course completion or training hours that can support job applications.​\r\n\r\nRealistic timelines\r\n\r\n    Basic literacy improvements: noticeable gains may occur over 2–6 months with steady attendance.​\r\n\r\n    GED/HiSET: many guests need 6–12 months to prepare and pass all sections, depending on starting level and life disruptions.​\r\n\r\n    Vocational certificates: some short programs last 4–12 weeks; longer or licensed programs can require many months of training.​\r\n\r\nRealistic outcomes\r\n\r\n    Improved confidence, ability to complete job applications, and readiness for interviews.​\r\n\r\n    Better access to higher-paying jobs due to GED or training credentials.​\r\n\r\n    Stronger financial habits and a clearer plan for housing and employment.​\r\n\r\nWhat To Expect as a Student\r\n\r\n    A supportive environment that understands relapse, mental health struggles, and life disruption are common; staff aim to encourage, not shame.​\r\n\r\n    Flexible pacing; if you miss classes due to appointments or crises, you can often re-engage without starting from zero.​\r\n\r\n    Use of adaptive learning software so you can work at your own level and speed.​\r\n\r\n    Collaboration between education staff, case managers, and therapists to align your education goals with recovery and housing plans.​\r\n\r\nHow To Apply or Get Started\r\n\r\n    If you are already at URM, ask for the Learning Center or talk to your case manager.​\r\n\r\n    If you are not yet staying at URM, start by entering emergency services or a transitional/recovery program; education services are primarily for guests.​\r\n\r\n    For questions, URM lists a Learning Center contact phone (e.g., Learning Center Director at 213-316-2752; confirm with URM’s current directory as numbers can change over time).​\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n\r\n

(if you are single) or F.E.S. (if you are a family).​\r\n\r\n    You will review program fees, expectations, and your income situation.​\r\n\r\n    Intake may include budgeting review, savings plan, and service plan development.​\r\n\r\nIf you are not yet at URM\r\n\r\n    Call (213) 347-6300 and ask how to access emergency shelter for singles or families and express interest in transitional programs.​\r\n\r\n    After entering emergency shelter, request a meeting with a case manager to see if you qualify for S.E.S. or F.E.S.​\r\n\r\nProgram Comparison Guide\r\nUnion Rescue Mission Program Comparison Guide\r\n\r\nThis guide compares URM’s key program types: Emergency, Transitional, and Recovery.\r\nProgram Types at a Glance\r\nProgram / Level\tWho It’s For\tLength\tCost to Guest\tFaith-Based Level\tEmployment Requirement\tBest Fit Situation\r\nEmergency Services (Downtown URM)\tSingle adults and families needing immediate shelter, food, and safety.​​\tNight-to-night; flexible, some stays longer based on need and space.​​\tFree for basic emergency beds and meals.​​\tFaith-based environment; chapel and spiritual care available but basic emergency access is low-barrier.​​\tNone; guests may be unemployed or working.​\tNew to URM, in crisis, or unsure about long-term commitment.\r\nS.E.S.

this allows them to save money while paying low or no rent.​\r\n\r\n    This model supports building a savings cushion for move-in costs (deposit, first month’s rent) once they transition to permanent housing.​\r\n\r\nFaith-Based Elements\r\n\r\n    Regular chapel services, Bible studies, prayer times, and discipleship are integrated across all phases.​\r\n\r\n    Recovery is framed as reconnecting with God, self, and others, with emphasis on grace, accountability, and community.​\r\n\r\n    Men are encouraged to engage with local churches and faith communities as part of their long-term support network.​\r\n\r\nParticipation in these elements is central to the Emmaus model; men should be comfortable with a Christian recovery environment, even if they are in different stages of belief.​\r\nEmployment Outcomes & Transition Planning\r\n\r\nEmployment outcomes\r\n\r\n    Many graduates move into steady employment, often in trades, service industries, or roles connected to their training.​\r\n\r\n    Some pursue further education, trade school, or ministry training.​\r\n\r\nTransition planning\r\n\r\n    Throughout Phases 2 and 3, case managers help men set realistic goals for income, savings, and housing.​\r\n\r\n    Plans may include:\r\n\r\n        Securing full-time work before graduation.\r\n\r\n        Saving a set amount toward deposits and emergency funds.\r\n\r\n        Applying for housing programs or affordable units.​\r\n\r\nRealistic timelines\r\n\r\n    From entering Phase 1 through the end of apprenticeship, a man might spend 1.5–3 years connected to Emmaus and URM support.​\r\n\r\n    Progress depends on individual recovery pace, relapse episodes, health, and job market conditions.​\r\n\r\nEligibility, Application, and Program Limitations\r\n\r\nEligibility\r\n\r\n    Adult men, typically 18+, experiencing homelessness and seeking long-term recovery.​\r\n\r\n    Ability to live in a structured, faith-based environment and follow program rules.​\r\n\r\nHow to apply\r\n\r\n    If staying at URM, speak to a chaplain, case manager, or intake worker and say you are interested in the “Emmaus Recovery Program.”​\r\n\r\n    If you are outside URM, call (213) 347-6300 and ask about intake for men’s recovery.​\r\n\r\n    Expect an interview, assessments, and possibly medical clearance or detox prior to full entry.​\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\n    Not a medical or psychiatric hospital; men requiring intensive inpatient or psychiatric care may be referred to higher-level facilities first.​\r\n\r\n    Space is limited; wait lists are possible, and admission may depend on bed availability and readiness for the program.​\r\n\r\n","category":"health","tags":"[\"Union Rescue Mission\",\"Emmaus Program\",\"Mens Recovery\",\"Substance Use Recovery\",\"Trauma-Informed Care\",\"Faith-Based Program\",\"Residential Recovery\"]","summary":"Men’s Emmaus Recovery Program\r\n\r\nEmmaus is URM’s faith-based residential recovery program for men, designed to address addiction and deep-rooted trauma while building pathways to work, education, a...","authorId":null,"isPublished":1,"viewCount":0,"createdAt":1770946559,"updatedAt":1770946559}]},{"name":"calendarEvents","columns":["id","userId","caseId","title","description","eventType","startTime","endTime","location","reminderEnabled","reminderTime","reminderSent","isCompleted","notes","createdAt","updatedAt"],"rows":[]},{"name":"caseDocuments","columns":["id","caseId","documentName","documentType","description","status","fileUrl","fileKey","uploadedAt","templateUrl","instructions","dueDate","isRequired","sortOrder","notes","createdAt","updatedAt"],"rows":[]},{"name":"caseMilestones","columns":["id","caseId","milestoneName","description","status","completedAt","sortOrder","notes","createdAt","updatedAt"],"rows":[]},{"name":"chat_conversations","columns":["id","userId","title","lastMessageAt","createdAt"],"rows":[]},{"name":"chat_messages","columns":["id","conversationId","role","content","createdAt"],"rows":[]},{"name":"events","columns":["id","title","description","eventType","category","startDate","endDate","startTime","endTime","isRecurring","recurrencePattern","recurrenceDetails","venueName","address","city","zipCode","latitude","longitude","isOnline","onlineUrl","phone","email","website","registrationUrl","servicesOffered","tags","eligibility","registrationRequired","cost","organizerName","organizerId","isPublished","isFeatured","viewCount","createdAt","updatedAt"],"rows":[{"id":1,"title":"The Source: Monthly Resource Fair","description":"The Source offers a one-stop-shop of resources and services to help homeless Angelenos transition to independent and supported living.

As a case manager, you can initiate\r\nthose referrals and advocate for your clients when contacting agencies.\r\nBy leveraging these programs—LIFE, Cityride, GoPass, Access Services, Section 8,\r\nCalWORKs assistance, HOPWA and LAHSA resources—you can help clients in Los Angeles\r\ngain mobility and access stable housing","embedding":null,"tokenCount":1763,"createdAt":1770789671},{"id":6,"documentId":81,"chunkIndex":0,"content":"Los Angeles Free & Low-Cost Dental Resources (FINAL, COMPLETE LIST)\r\n\r\nEmergency • Sliding Scale • Medi-Cal/Denti-Cal • Homeless-Friendly • Payment Plans\r\n\r\nI’m listing 12 resources instead of forcing it to 10, because cutting these would be irresponsible for real-world use.\r\n1) Homeless Not Toothless (HNT)\r\n\r\nBest for: homeless & extremely low-income clients needing full dental restoration\r\n\r\n    Website: https://www.homelessnottoothless.org\r\n\r\n    Services: exams, fillings, crowns, dentures\r\n\r\n    Cost: free or very low cost\r\n\r\n    Access: referral-based nonprofit network\r\n\r\n    Notes: excellent for dentures and complex cases\r\n\r\n2) St. John’s Community Health (SJCH)\r\n\r\nBest for: Medi-Cal, uninsured, undocumented\r\n\r\n    Dental Appointments: (323) 541-1411\r\n\r\n    Website: https://www.sjch.org\r\n\r\n    Services: cleanings, fillings, extractions, emergency dental\r\n\r\n    Cost: sliding scale, Denti-Cal accepted\r\n\r\n    Locations: South LA, DTLA, Westside\r\n\r\n3) Lestonnac Free Clinic\r\n\r\nBest for: low/no-income adults, limited coverage gaps\r\n\r\n    Website: https://www.lestonnacfreeclinic.org\r\n\r\n    Counties Served: Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino\r\n\r\n    Services: basic dental, preventive care\r\n\r\n    Cost: free\r\n\r\n    Access: appointment + eligibility screening\r\n\r\n🟢 This was one you were right to flag.

As a case manager, you can initiate\r\nthose referrals and advocate for your clients when contacting agencies.\r\nBy leveraging these programs—LIFE, Cityride, GoPass, Access Services, Section 8,\r\nCalWORKs assistance, HOPWA and LAHSA resources—you can help clients in Los Angeles\r\ngain mobility and access stable housing","embedding":null,"tokenCount":1763,"createdAt":1770855336}]},{"name":"knowledge_documents","columns":["id","title","filename","filepath","fileType","category","summary","wordCount","chunkCount","createdAt","updatedAt"],"rows":[{"id":1,"title":"2020 Survial Guide","filename":"2020-Survial-Guide.pdf","filepath":"C:\\Users\\brandon\\Downloads\\virgil-st_new_mvp\\knowledge_files\\2020-Survial-Guide.pdf","fileType":"pdf","category":"identification","summary":"2020 | ESCAMBIA AND SANTA ROSA COUNTIES\r\nSTREET SURVIVAL GUIDE\r\nGET CONNECTED.
