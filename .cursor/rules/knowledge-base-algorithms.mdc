# knowledge-base-algorithms

Knowledge Base Core Components (Importance Score: 90/100):

1. Document Processing Engine
- Domain-specific chunking for legal/social services content
- Custom categorization system based on service types:
  - Legal aid materials
  - Housing resources
  - Treatment options
  - Crisis intervention
- Specialized metadata extraction for eligibility requirements
- Multi-language document processing support

2. Semantic Search Implementation (Importance Score: 85/100)
- Custom vector embeddings optimized for social services terminology
- Domain-weighted relevance scoring:
  - Higher weights for crisis/emergency content
  - Service eligibility matching
  - Geographic service area relevance
- Context-aware query expansion for social services terminology

3. Knowledge Integration System (Importance Score: 95/100)
- AI response generation with domain-specific prompting
- Source citation tracking for legal/service information
- Treatment facility knowledge base integration
- Service provider directory integration
- Real-time resource availability tracking
